The when's of antisemitis:
so, we can see how in hungary we see anti semitic laws already in the
'20, but a fascist party in the '39.
In Italy the party is born in '24
Most as some form of counter vs the Urss.

Anywat about Production:
Only the Reich has industries comparable with Anglo and also 
how it could affort 1/4 of funds in aviation, while others footsoldiers.
also population of Italy and Urss 40% farmers.
15 elements needed for war in 1940 and between the states that had
a surplus of food only Romania was in the Axis, on production of wheat
Usa 15%, Argentina 5%, east europe 7%.
while being 33/ 20 / 7% of mundial exportation.
Chimic needed for gunpowler, explosives and raffination of oil.

Roomania before changing party sent 1.2M soldiers.
on 1939 the Reich had only few months of oil before Romania.
also thanks to Syntetic fuel with charcoal and will cover untill
40% needs in '43, a dn balance will be lost in '44 after Usa strikes on production.
Jap by '40 will have just 8.6% covered before Oland colonies (Sumatra)
but here Usa boats will negate most of supply after '43.
conquering Borneo on '43.

Oil Production of Urss wont be damaged by offensives of '41-'42 by a lot
but due to auto-sabotas will lose 43% and will need supply by Usa.

Allies will have complementary weapon production like Urss on heavy
and not receivig meaningfull attacks by '42.
Also italy wont supply the "millione di aionette" and Jap wont be
able to upgrade during war.

even with teh USA production 5X due to quality it tended to lose 4:1 carr vs reich  
Urss re-porpused easily factories.
lack of no ferrose metals the urss equals the reich for ammo production.
'38 the axis had 3X aereo but will get to 1/3 by '44
the jap navy will dissolve in '44
Uk sub-appalted factories and in US with Taylorism to get

90% of nichel produced by colonies.
the 2M employed in india were locally while 85% of NZ were sent.
Lend.leise act in '41, by roosvelt, which cancels the previous
cash and carry act from '39 whch will allow to help countries 
lend receive which safety is important for the US.
help of 49 Billionsfor Gb, Cina, Urss and free France.
47% of militar equipment and 62% on GB, used to rebuilt france army while
Urss still without during moskow or stalingrad.
Different standards for production for armies and 75% of boots went to urss with the
