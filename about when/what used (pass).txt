about what was used

so the hat, from the '40-'50 it stopped being used to then being
re-manstered, used fro status and protect vs dirt, but on car it was
useless but also cultural.
from the hat research associasocin we noted how some didnt want to continue after
having had to use hats during ww2, 20%.
and some towns produced so conseguences, the hat week, the cilindro of j.f. kennedy
and the lack of use of it marked the new for hair.
bucked for cappelli da pescatori.

ok so maniglie, 1878, brevetto even trought mechanism like that existed before
door closing design , simple pomel, sometimes luchetti
or not coz the welth in bauli, not clear when started to used in antichita, welth used
to show off, 
architetti started occcupying on it from '900, on liberty style to Anton gaudi (catalan modernism)
then Bahuaus, 
the most common maniglia by philosofo, 1 year of project,
