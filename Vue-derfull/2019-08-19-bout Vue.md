export default {
    name: 'app',
    data: []
}

I guess this is how we did it in our second project

new Vue({
    el: '#app',
    data: []
)}

That is typically your root Vue instance that the rest of the application descends from. This hangs off the root element declared in an html document, most of the times in a html file(just addig or managing it)

you can create a new Vue instance with this syntax because it takes it from the
existing code (thats why it targets #) and you put stuff on it

While **the one** we are using to declare a conponent we plan in
re-using and import later

so at the end they werent similar and we uses export default
and it seems that we are exporting a module with it

and now its time to create an instace.
to allow us to, routes object.

so:

import VueRouter from 'vue-router'

import routes from './routes';

Vue.use(VueRouter)

Vue.config.productionTip = false

const router = new VueRouter({routes});

ok so, in theory we didnt set Vuerouter anywwhere in the folder
but I guess we are just giving it a name here.
we anyway import the routes from the export default routes;
we set the vue.use(of the value we created)

and set the const for the routeR with creating a new vuerouter with the
value routeS.

ok so, we set the router/links/display for the routes in app.vue.

    <nav>
        <router-link to='/'>Home</router-link>
        <router-link to='/register'>Register</router-link>
        <router-link to='/login'>Login</router-link>
    </nav>
    <router-view />

the nav tag is optional BUT we have to set the router-view on the botton
and we set all the links needed with respective routes....

ok so, lets start with:

const routes = [
    { path: '/', component: Home },
    { path: '/register', component: Register },
    { path: '/login', component: Login },
];

on **routes.js** we set the path, and the component, whiche means
the actual content of the new page.

we use the imported routes:

import routes from './routes';

and create a VueRouter, 

const router = new VueRouter({routes});

which we created 
	import VueRouter from 'vue-router'
and which we settled 
	Vue.use(VueRouter)

anyway now to the app.vue, we set the links

      <router-link to='/'>Home </router-link>
      <router-link to='/register'>Register </router-link>
      <router-link to='/login'>Login</router-link>

and them are linked trought the router-link tag...
but to show their **content** we need something more

    <router-view />

which will set the entire **component** of the set router-link route...

ok so router-link is for navigation, we get the target with to=" "
AND IF I WANTED TO, I could configure one with the prop tag
[which would mean the a tag with a href linked]

there are different ways in which a router works
and this tag seems to work with HTML5 history mode and hash mode
(I mean our front page has hard coded links.....)

anyway even if I set target="_blank"_ and make it open a new page
I always get the whole page plus the content....

> should I get like a new template for this kind of pages...

so, about the router-view

The router-view component is a functional component that 
renders the matched component for the given path.

in the router-link we set where we want the link to go to:
and in the main.js

const router = new VueRouter({routes});

we set from the imported routes what components will it find 
in the correspondent .vue file...

and nested path...I guess a router-view can be inside another

	<router-view> Props

I guess I should check that later...

anyway it seems that the 
	router-view
can indeed be open and closed, but not in this case

ok so, it seems that untill now we used the :

Hash routing which is popular in building a Single Page Application(SPA).

.... I guess we will see how to use the history mode.
that we have to tell it externally on the HTML5

ok so we add  mode: 'history',

const router = new VueRouter({
  mode: 'history',
  routes
});

ok so, the idea is to route the components without the hash...
ok so, in order to archive a dynamic segment.

ok so, we create a new route.vue file.
a component inside the src >> components folder called Student.vue.

with the typical import and and path but:

    { path: '/student/:id', component: Student },

I have to check if :id is something I have to put in the name, anyway
its set to be unique for each.

inside the .vue route component.

 Student Id should be : {{ $route.params.id }}

 we reference the route with the $route.
 but where did we set the params? also from where we get the id?
 (even if think its generated)

 and so we didnt find a way to get a botton to get it but there is no probs
 just add a:

       <router-link to='/student/:id'>Student</router-link>

in the app.vue.

which will be exported as app into the main.js
and there will get the correspondent **component** from the routes

	import routes from './routes';

which we also got from: 

the routes array in the routes.js in which we added

	    { path: '/student/:id', component: Student },

and into the component we set 

	Student Id should be : {{ $route.params.id }}

which indeed set the id if we change manually the id on the search window

We can use this id parameter to load the contents from a backend.
now its time to see how 
	this.$router:  which is the router object.
	this.$route:  which is the current route object.

works..anyway we can access the **router object**
using **this.$router** from any component when a Vue Router is 
installed in the root

and you can use:

this.$router.push()
this.$router.replace()
this.$router.go()

and I guess we are gonna use it to simplify the routes paths..
for first we are gonna add a name to the various paths

ok so, giving each element of the array Routes a name allow us to change
how we use them in app.vue,

    { path: '/student/:id', component: Student, name:'student'},

and into the app.vue / router-link

      <router-link :to="{name: 'student', params: {id: 2}}">Student</router-link>

here is where we set the params and an id (which we set to be followed and printed as such)

ok anyway , remember to have :to {which works only when brakets}

ok so, we need to allow the page to re-load after certain functions are done with
(like logging in) 

we create a new .vue file in components
with 
	export default {
    mounted() {
        this.$router.push('/home');
    }
}

the we import it to the routes.js and we add a router link to app and done
anyway, we have to check how 
    mounted() {
        this.$router.push('/home');
    }

actually works.
anyway I guess the mounted refers to being entered by the user.

## ok, time to see how does the route go for the second.

ok so, like always in the route.js we import the .md file.
and set its path and name in the routes like this: 

	import Foo from './components/foo.md'

  routes: [
    { path: '/', name: 'home', component: Home },
    { path: '/foo', name: 'foo', component: Foo }

we created a .json file in which we keep all the info about all new posts
and so we start with **dynamic imports**

	import Blogs from './statics/blogs.json'

	  routes: [
    { path: '/', name: 'home', component: Home },
    ...Blogs.map(entry => ({
      path: `/${entry}`,
      name: entry,
      component: () => import(`./markdowns/${entry}.md`)
    }))

as you can see, we set the title of any new file as entry, name and path
(to be find from the imported .json file I guess)
now, the entry defined in paths is something that I find in the .json file
and the component something I find in the markdown folder.

we created an obeject on the .json file, and keys....
object.keys( ) referes to the numerical element present on a set list 
of elements in the object.

ok so, we have different entries from different sections

	import BlogEntries from './statics/data/blogs.json';

	const blogRoutes = Object.keys(BlogEntries).map(section => {
	  const children = BlogEntries[section].map(child => ({
	    path: child.id,
	    name: child.id,
	    component: () => import(`./markdowns/${section}/${child.id}.md`)
	  }))
	  return {
	    path: `/${section}`,
	    name: section,
	    component: () => import('./views/Blog.vue'),
	    children
	  }
	})

ok first lets check how .map works, anyway we go and get the keys from
BlogEntries which we imported form the .json file.
we ake it pass trought a function...it gives back,it iteretes trought all elements
(the keys of the object)and returns a stringarray of elements

just map those blog sections into route objects, so the idea is to create 
child sections which are inside a more larger section, so to be accessed with 
	./markdowns/${section}/${child.id}.md

and to return just the bigger sections I guess.

	export default new Router({
	  mode: 'history',
	  base: process.env.BASE_URL,
	  routes: [
	    {
	      path: '/',
	      name: 'home',
	      component: Home
	    },
	    ...blogRoutes
	  ]
	})

this part is no so different.

	<template>
	  <div class="blog">
	    <router-view />
	    <router-link to="/" tag="a" class="back">&laquo; Back</router-link>
	  </div>
	</template>

ok so, we set the style and add an element to our router/view. (in this case a botton)

.blog {
  max-width: 50vw;
  margin: 10rem auto;
  /deep/ {
    h1 {
      font-size: 3rem;
      margin-bottom: .2rem;
      color: #42b883;
    }
    h4 {
      margin-bottom: 3rem;
      color: #35495e;
    }
  }
}

now we need to see how /deep/ works and how does it style the router-view element
'style' elements inside child components, it just works, I guess its a specific class

## starting to adress the second blog.

we are gonna use the botton back to show content down below for now.
ok so, in our first example we add those in app.js and dont even 
modify the home.vue page.

so, are we forced into a single page? in any case we need to check what do we need to do
in our front page.

in home.vue we want to show all the entries and -json elements form the posts
so we :

	<script>
	import BLOGENTRIES from '@/statics/data/blogs.json'

	export default {
	  name: 'home',
	  computed: {
	    entries() {
	      return BLOGENTRIES
	    }
	  }
	}

	</script>

import the vanilla .json file , which I guess is different from:

	export default {
	  name: 'HelloWorld',
	  props: {
	    msg: String,
	    testo: String
	  },
	}

ok so, instead of props (which just defined the type of data you wanted to export
and then fill in app.vue we use computed....)
which I guess fill entries with the elements found in BlogEntries.

anyway about computed -> Computed. used for complex properties.
anyway we provide and just like I said, to developt a function (in this case just an array but still)
to export.

ok so, to export we decide to add a new name.... I stil dont know If I can do that

	export default {
	  name: 'home',
	  computed: {
	    entries() {
	      return BLOGENTRIES
	    }
	  },
	  name: 'resto',
	  props: {
	    testo: String
	  }
	}

so we export to app.js now...

and we discover that in app.vue there is no script.....
I guess he showed everything into the first vue page.
anywayto do what we wanted to do we add 

	<resto testo="ok so this is where we will get the coding next"/>

in the template and.... we import and we set somthing to export from here.

	<script>

	import resto from '/views/Home.vue'

	export default {
	  name: 'app',
	  components: {
	    resto
	  }
	}

	</script>

in our main.js we imported the router but not yet the routes... anyway we dont need it yet
I guess.

ok so, we didnt set up a router so I guess I am done, lets try if 

ok so, lets re-cap a bit here.

we already proved how we add an expression on home.vue

        <h2> {{ testo }} </h2>

and give it a name so we can export it together with a bigger object.

	export default {
	  name: 'home',
	  computed: {
	    entries() {
	      return BLOGENTRIES
	    }
	  },
	  props: {
	    testo: String
	  }
	}

then we import them in app.js with the bigger object.

	import home from './views/Home.vue'

but use only what we need in the template.

        <home testo="ok so this is where we will get the coding next"/>

we export the rest to main.js to finish the rendering:

	export default {
	  name: 'app',
	  components: {
	    home
	  }
	}

and then nothing to add to the main.js file.
just remembering the:

	import App from './App.vue'

now about adding a route with linked a estra .vue page

first we create one inside where the .vue files are located.
we import it in routes.js

	import coding from './views/coding.vue'

I also set the Vue.use(Router), using as name the route imported.
import Router from 'vue-router'

now the difference is that here there was just a simple array with the 
routes = [ elements and path]

here we created a new element


	export default new Router({
	  mode: 'history',
	  base: process.env.BASE_URL,
	  routes: [
	    {
	      path: '/',
	      name: 'home',
	      component: Home
	    },
	    { 
	      path: '/coding',
	      name:'coding',
	      component: coding
	    },
	    ...blogRoutes
	  ]
	})

routes is still present so there we add another one with the data imported, to render it
we, go directly to app.vue (no passing trought main.js considerng we
already set the routes as global, or something, I guess)

and simply render it:

        <router-link to='/coding'> show the code </router-link>
        <router-view/>

we set a link to go somewhere, and at that somewhere it will find the .vue file
we set before.

## about the feedback
 
try to see the feedback with little detachment / try curiosity, 

### getting serious.

ok so, in the script, we dont just say what kind of data we want to export but we
define it:

	export default {
	  name: 'home',
	  props:{

	  	},
	  data () {
	    return {
	      msg: 'Welcome to Your Vue.js App'
	    }
	  }
	}

I will just put it together with the rest of data I want to Export with the name.

## ok so, lets try again

I build a new project and we are gonna see if we can make it work with no 
router.js file. 

ok so after getting the data() { return : ''}
 on the front page (with name we are gonna import to our main.js.)

	 export default new Router({
	  routes: [
	    {
	      path: '/',
	      name: 'home',
	      component: content
	    }
	  ]
	})

we link the export to new Router and with the object array.
the component will have to have the name of the name imported 
while the name is free to set.

ok so, It seems you dont have to use arrow functions in the data() property.

ok so, in the last demo we created we saw how we had to export props with the 
data and then to write down the content in a tag with the same name.

    <HelloWorld 
      msg="Welcome to Your Vue.js App"
      testo="https://www.ilpost.it/2019/08/21/salvini-scarso/"
    />

after exporting mgs with props: string and the name Helloworld.

anyway, we didnt just do that. 

ok so, we cannot import content coz we dont know how to use it in app.js.
but It seems that we want to isolate the content on the singles .vue pages
from what it is on the app.vue.

ok, lets try to see the differences here, in our version we tried to
fuse the routes.js in our main.js, to work with them separated.

ok so, in our main.js, after 

	import router from 'vue-router'
	import routes from './routes';

seting up the router and routes, and also you dont export....

ok so, now we are gonna see how to add a boostrap template to our project...
I guess I will start with that and then check how to style even further
with all the html I learned.

ok so, to add boostrap we go directly to the home.vue template.
we add a botton we install the boostrap with npm.

	npm install bootstrap jquery popper.js

and we import the results in main.js

	import 'bootstrap'
	import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css'

ok so, it seems that we 

anyway if we want to add a new page we create the .vue file
set an export default, import the path on the routes.js file
add it to the object routes with path and component imported, and done...

anwyay we set the router-link to:

              <li class="nav-item">
                <router-link class="nav-link" to="/blog">Blog</router-link>
              </li>

and we just use the to=' ' syntax, I will see if I use the **name** on those.

using parameters, ok so, remember when I set and used data (text and stuff) in
the same page. component? well I am gonna do it wil images.

and now we want to link our h3 text to a new page with a link adding

	@click="goTodetail()"

and we add this method to the object after closing the gallery.

	  methods:{
		  goTodetail() {
		    this.$router.push({name:'details'})
	  }

ok so in case you have problems in repeating the name just avoid setting too
many same names.

	 export default{
	  name:'forth',
	  data(){
	   return{
	    title:" trying different name"
	   }
	  }
	 }

	import forth from '@/components/details'

name of the file and name of the export are different then on the path:

      {path: '/details', name: 'details',component: forth}

we set the path to the correct .vue file the component of the export and 
a different name.

also put the method **out** of the data()

  name: 'pagina',
  data () {
    return {
      texto: 'welcome to the actual content of this page',
      gallery: [
        {
        },
      ]
    }
  },
  methods:{
      goTodetail() {
        this.$router.push({name:'details'})
     }
  }

 ok so , we wanna add the id data/ params into our method.
 first we type them down.

	<h3 @click="goTodetail(data.productId)" >{{data.productTitle}}</h3>

we want it to work with data we get inside the data.producttitle

and we modify also the method.

	this.$router.push({name:'details',params:{Pid:proId}})

we need to ad the parameter Pid,I guess I add it to a current one.

      {path: '/details/:Pid', name: 'details',component: forth}

even If I dont know how its supposed to print the number if its a path.
ok so, lets be clear , its ez.

we give an argumet to the function/method

	goTodetail(data.galleryId)

it being a number we gave to it so we could use the v-for.

  methods:{
      goTodetail(proId) {
        this.$router.push({name:'details',params:{Pid:proId}})
     }
  }

 ok so, we change the name of the argument (I guess we can), and set the push with
 another argument (before we just give it the name of the path of the .vue file we
 wanted it to follow) and pass the value of Pid: as the already said proId
 now we modify the path to show the value in the path that this$push follows

	{path: '/details/:Pid', name: 'details',component: forth}

nothing changes except the number on the top anyway.

and to print it on just use:

	:{{this.$route.params.Pid}}

there can be possible params so I guess we get one by specifying ._
and the standard this.% which reflects how did we got that value.

and if we wanna show an correspondant image we go.

first we set up in the return part of the data()

    proId: this.$route.params.Pid,

we already named it in our past $push, I guess its for using it without all the fanfare we did with

	:{{this.$route.params.Pid}}

anyway we create another v-for to rotate inside the elements 
but set only the one we got in our proId as value..

    <div class="col-md-12" v-for="(product,index) in gallery" :key="index">

we get 2 arguments inside a v-for, we create the first and the second to refer
as the current index of the current item.

to search in the gallery(which we will define in the data of our .vue stil)
ok so about :key.. special attribute, its used to help Vue
and it will order elements based on its keys, 
and here we base ourself in the current index of this page (which I guess for now is
unique), 

	<div v-if="proId == product.galleryId">

here we set conditions in which we set the value we imported and set in data.
to be equal as the galleryId of the product element took with the :key
so the galleryId = number = proId

and considering we can enter the product element we can use the elements inside

      <h1>{{product.prompt}}</h1>
      <img :src="product.image" class="img-fluid">

and we again use it.

  data(){
   return{
    proId: this.$route.params.Pid,
    title: " trying different name",
    gallery: [
        {
          prompt: 'lets try the movement',
          image: require('../assets/case.jpg'),
          galleryId:1
        },
        {
          prompt: 'can I see it?',
          image: require('../assets/berlin.jpg'),
          galleryId:2
        }
      ]
   }
  }

 time for a transition.

ok so , to animate the content we target router-view
and get it into a tag.

        <transition name="Feeling">
          <router-view/>
        </transition>

and to get it with actual content we go to the **style** tag

	.Feeling-enter-active{
	  opacity: 0;
	  transition: opacity 1s ease-in;
	}

but we need to impost the keyframes after it.
and the function you saw has to be set both for enter than
for leave.

ok so, we seem cannot update the node-modules in our repository.
start with git init.
in the folder you want to update, git add .
if you want to add all, and after its done we
git commit -m "here comes the text"
then git remote add origin ttps://github.com/Misterlinux/quasi-blog.git
git push -u origin master

this on the typical upload of a folder on github.

ok so it seems that vue-router and router are different considering one is
official, the typical

	npm install vue-router

and then to use it just.

	import Vue from 'vue'
	import VueRouter from 'vue-router'

	Vue.use(VueRouter)

ok so here they tralk about the use of $this.router/route.. lets see

we used it as a method   

	methods:{
      goTodetail(proId) {
        this.$router.push({name:'details',params:{Pid:proId}})
     }
  }

 and then imported and used as: 

     proId: this.$route.params.Pid,

as a condition and a value.

     <div v-if="proId == product.galleryId">

    <h3>the product id is :{{ proId }}</h3>

ok so with $this.router we access the router object.
and can be used to navigate to a new route....

we use the name="" to go to the path with that name, 
and the data present in the object about goTodetail(data.galleryId)
is passed trought another name as proId to the path the this is 
pushing in.

then to enter the value proId > from the param Pid >  to this.$route.params.Pid,
as proId, again...

anyway we accessed a value present into the page and then some.

we can also use 

	this.$router.replace()
	this.$router.go()

even If I have yet to see how...
ok so, like we saw before there are different modes in which
we can set our router, one of those was the 'history mode'
and I guess you cant use the $this on them considering it says it resemble

	pushState, replaceState and go methods of the History API.

even If I set the:

	const router = new VueRouter({
	  mode: 'history',
	  routes
	});

in our main.js.

To navigate to a different URL, use router.push. This method pushes a 
new entry into the history stack, so when the user clicks the browser 
back button they will be taken to the previous URL.

more or less what I said before, anyway I should have new data to insert.

	Declarative	Programmatic
	<router-link :to="...">	router.push(...)

ok so,anyway, we can use router-link tag even out of app.vue, kinda obvious
 in case you wanted to use name "{ name: 'Page2' }"

 ok so, lets see how to set the push botton from the script (router link is for vue)

ok so, lets see how its organized... we first import the entire .json file.

	import BlogEntries from './statics/data/blogs.json';

then we will create our own?... I guess we are gonna order it a bit.
with:

	const blogRoutes = Object.keys(BlogEntries).map(section => {

now I know that map is used to get a funtion to filter the results but I will check again what I
used .keys for and where, 

anyway here we are actually working on an object...I mean we arent using a v-for yet so.
to iterate trought the **propeties of an object**

	<ul id="v-for-object" class="demo">
	  <li v-for="value in object">
	    {{ value }}
	  </li>
	</ul>

to get the value iterating trought the project searching for.
with an object like:

	new Vue({
	  el: '#v-for-object',
	  data: {
	    object: {
	      title: 'How to do lists in Vue',
	      author: 'Jane Doe',
	      publishedAt: '2016-04-10'
	    }
	  }
	})

ok so v-for it seems its not a special id I guess, but we still have to define
an object as such, (I guess the id is used to locate something) 

and you can provide multiple aruments depending of what you need:

	div v-for="(value, name) in object">
then to use as template of course, {value}: {name}

ok so object.keys is about order, so I guess we are using the .map to set the
order of .keys inside this object.

anyway we create a new array, trought a function...we are using a section...

	const blogRoutes = Object.keys(BlogEntries).map(section => {
	  const children = BlogEntries[section].map(child => ({
	    path: child.id,
	    name: child.id,
	    component: () => import(`./markdowns/${section}/${child.id}.md`)
	  }))

ok so, we got the first line and I kinda see how the 'section' is just the
name of the array we want to create with map.... 
so.... we create:

> a section formed by the key values I find in the BlogEntries (which would)
> be the names of the argumenst in my case and setted as a const blogRoutes

then, once inside of them we create the const of children which is formed by
mapping down the inside of BlogEntries[section].map(mapping and creating the child 
element) adìnd setting ana array with values as path / name.
and a **component**

	component: () => import(`./markdowns/${section}/${child.id}.md`)

the name and path are the same and set in the json file. and we import based on the names
and on the names of the .md files.

and whats the return?:

	  return {
	    path: `/${section}`,
	    name: section,
	    component: () => import('./views/Blog.vue'),
	    children
	  }

I guess the return refersof the path/name and component of the section array created...
and also the fact that has nested children inside of it too.

and then you export a new router with routes inside of it.

anyway like I maybe said before, we start by creating a vue-config and to run the test we.
create a new .md file, which has to be used in the app.js file....

ok so, after taking capocciate on the code we kinda make the vue.config.js file work..
I guess it becoz we installed the https://www.npmjs.com/package/vue-markdown-loader
in our terminal, or becoz we transfered some js files from the old project 
on ours, anway .

anyway the module.export allow us to import modules even if they dont come
with a export.default on the script part.

ok so, lets give it some context....considering I can now import / export it
I can add a route about it without having to create a page for it...
I can make it load on the same page I access to it....

or even simpler, not having the import on the script part of your specific page but in
included in your :to / path, with a component I guess?

ok so , component is needed coz it summarize the imported value /while the route deploys it
(the component is just a way to put the imported foo into the path '/foo')

and if we want to create a button or the .push then..

    <button type="button" class="btn btn-primary" v-on:click="navigate()"> 
        minus 1
    </button>

no matter what you put in the tag before, just remember to reference the event that 
activates the method, then in the script:

   methods: {
      navigate() {
          this.$router.go(-1);
      }
   }

and then some, I mean you use the -go() function after the this.%router.go
I remember that before I said the differences between router/routes.

ok so, now we are starting to get interesting.... we create a json file in which we keep all the
**names** of the of the markdown:

	[
	    "foo",
	    "the-second"
	]

and in the routes we: 

and using dynamics imports:

      ...Blogs.map(entry => ({
        path: `/${entry}`,
        name: entry,
        component: () => import(`./markdowns/${entry}.md`)
      }))

so, we take from the Blog imported json file, and use .map to set up an array from which take the
elemenst we are gonna be using, and we set up each new element with a path / which takes each 
element of the .json file and create a path for it, a name (which is the same of the said element)

and about the component, we use the name as guide to search for it in the markdowns folder.
(something tells me that the $ allow us to interact with elements of the router)

and now its time to create a series of links based on the routes.

and now its time to go for arguments.

ok so, after creating the folders for the new .md files we repeat the same names in our object.
and the only part of the element that has to be the same as the title of the file
is the id. the rest is added information.

and in a structure like:

    "Secondo": [
        {
            "id": "suono",
            "date": "25 agosto, 2019",
            "title": "this is the second",
            "description": "it should be all ok."
        }
    ]

we get the object key taht will work as a section and then below we get an array with each 
*blog-entry*, in which we use the id to get the component.

now we upgrade the previous...as far as I can see I guess it s more like an external function
which then we include to our normal route.

    return {
      path: `/${section}`,
      name: section,
      component: () => import('./views/Blog.vue'),
      children
    }

ok so, I can see that the return here is used to the further creation of a
back-botton, so we have to create a template vue incorporated in each post that is open.
(I have to see if I can put more or just modify the vue file.)
we pre-view a component present in the future opened /section path which will import in it
the content of the blog.vue file, and the children I guess.

ok so, we now have 2 different router view? I mean I coded one in the blog.vue to be shown down
the .md file with the path set in the reurn.

ok so, the dude doesnt show us how to put it in the ul, I will see.

ok so, its kinda working but lets see. anyway, in app.js we can see that even if put before 
the:

	  <div id="app">
	      <img alt="Vue logo" src="./assets/logo.png">
	        <div class="navbar navbar-expand-lg fixed-top navbar-dark bg-primary">

the img tag will happear below the navbar, anyway, any element in app.js will
happear in any part of any file opened and mouted in it. just a tip.

ok so, it seems that the name of the folder in which it is importanta 
AND that its possible to have 2 router viw in the same project (I guess the return did its job)

I will have to find a way to know how to divide the sections between each other.

anywya about a vue app just:

	npm install -g @vue/cli

	vue create vueroute

to set up the router, which the name of the app. 

	npm install vue-router 

then just import in main.js:

	import Vue from 'vue'
	import VueRouter from 'vue-router'

	Vue.use(VueRouter)

then create components / pages, 

anyway about how to deal with params: 

	<template>
	    <div>
	        Student ID is: {{ $route.params.id }}
	    </div>
	</template>
	<script>
	export default {
	    
	}
	</script>

            <li>
                <router-link :to="{name: 'student', params: {id: 2}}">Student</router-link>
            </li>

just to see how to set up a link with a param to be displayed.

so, to set up a botton with a route / or to be mounted.
in a custom redirect.vue page:

	<template>
	    <div></div>
	</template>
	<script>
	export default {
	    mounted() {
	        this.$router.push('/home');
	    }
	}
	</script>

and in the route.

	import Redirect from './components/Redirect.vue';

	const routes = [
	    { path: '/student/:id', component: Student, name: 'student' },
	    { path: '/redirect', component: Redirect, name: 'redirect' },
	];

	export default routes;

or a 404.vue error page: 

	<template>
	    <div>
	        Whoops 404!! The page is not available.
	        <a href="#" @click.prevent="back">Go back</a>
	    </div>
	</template>
	<script>
	export default {
	    methods: {
	        back() {
	            this.$router.go(-1);
	        }
	    }
	}
	</script>

and same in the redirect:

	import Redirect from './components/Redirect.vue';
	import Error from './components/404.vue';

	const routes = [
	    { path: '/redirect', component: Redirect, name: 'redirect' },
	    { path: '/404', component: Error, name: '404' },
	];

	export default routes;

anyway, about what we do with the $router.push..

	this.$router.push({name:'details',params:{Pid:proId}})

we here passed 2 different types of params, 
and if I wanna insert an animationon the loading of each content just remember
to edit a div in which you put the:

        <transition name="Feeling">
          <router-view/>
        </transition>

anyway we can also use some standard synatx like:

      <a href="https://cli.vuejs.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vue-cli documentation</a>.

ok so, now we are gonna try to delete the route for the stand page 
but keep its role as router-link botton.

ok so, even if the clock evet allow us to get to the content of markdown
its the:

    return {
      path: `/${section}`,
      name: section,
      component: () => import('./components/gallery.vue'),
      children
    }

that sets the route in which the content is deploy.
inside the router-view ( anyway I do not need to have it have a route right?)

ok so, about, how the images are shown reember to include all in the 
div tag with the class="row" simple enought....and its necessary to
make i work. 

anyway about the back botton, it seems that its only on the template coz
I settled a return there. anyway I can add bottons with the push ot go 
in the code of the fue files anyway.

I tried to implememnt a tag head in the template but It didnt worked and deleted all the
changes I did with css, there is another way to implemenet except the

	<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Chilanka&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">

which is about the import syntax (to put in the style tag), so I guess I will try that instead of 
head, tag, and It doesnt work....

ok so, we are gonna create a toggler , first we create the space in which the hamb
menu will be.anyway, we also create the menu....all in classes...

ok so, now we are working with set variable in the css style tag.

ok so about the use and import of fonts just use the 

	@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Chilanka&display=swap');

and then used in the:

    font-family: 'Chilanka', cursive;

we are just adding the max-with /minimal padding and overflow transparent
and to use the variables colors in the css.

  background: var(--primary-color);

ok so it seems not working, I have to check out so I can use the color as a template

and about relative...we put this in the principal coz the next will be in absolute..
is it about grades of importance or maybe order of use..

ok so, now we are gonna create a :before element (selector)
anyway its about putting an image as a background.

this is where we use the position:absolute
and to avoid it to cover all the text remember the 

  z-index: -1;

I remember that it could be 0 or -1, anyway alow us to put it as a back

and I guess there is a level of transparence in the rba (thats why we use it)

anyway lets see how exacltly does the:

  background: url('https:') no-repeat center center/cover;

anyway, when we use the background: **property** we are using a shorthand, which
means including all the other elements of the background- (image, color..)

for example the -repeat, meaning, well, if we put it in round it crop the image to
get the whole picture but not in order...

about the center, its the background.position, and if sefined in numers/percentages its
in 0, 0 if not you can use top/bottom/l/r, or center like here,

ok it seems that in properties wrote in that way it would be better to keep any value
as a single sentence (so no 0 0 in our example)

	right 200px bottom;

and if you want to be more precise and include px in values, remember you cant use % here

and about the last, which is background size:

	  background: url(img_tree.gif), url(mountain.jpg);
	  background-repeat: no-repeat;
	  background-size: contain, cover;

in case you wanted to create 2, anyway, **cover** to get all the possible cutting maybe.
or use percentages about x/y (which will work as zoom of the image on the page with un-used space)
**contain** if you want all the image even with the empty space, 

ok so, we first modify / .showcase:before
and will modify the more precise .showcase .showcase-inner 
which is just the text inside.

and if you wat to mak ethe text more bold:

	font-size: 4rem;

anyway we define a bit of the btn and then give some css to the hoven

.btn:hover {
  opacity: 0.7;
}

about the transition-timing property:
(I dont know why is there the opacity element on it)
but it can be of:

ease,linear,ease-in,ease-out.

so we can target a propery in our transition property:

	transition: opacity 0.5s ease;

which we will use later:

.btn:hover {
  opacity: 0.65;
}

anyway, if we want our index/botton to be:

	position: fixed;

(which will keep even if scrool)

which we use with: 

	z-index: 1;

ok so, we create a botton but make it invisile.
I guess the toggler, Is used to check active or not.

	.menu-wrap .hamburger > div 

ok so, we want to target a specific tag...
anyway we are targetting a tag inside the already created amburger.

ok so, talking about the same selector we impoost :before / after.
which we set to do the same.....

	.menu-wrap .hamburger > div::before,
	.menu-wrap .hamburger > div::after

ad we also transform it into an X with :

	transform: rotate(90deg);

(I guess its cose we move 1 line into another to form an X).

in .menu-wrap .menu: we put all the values inside the icon 

	overflow: hidden;

anyway about the root, we just use it in another external file we link later.
anyway about the:

border-style: outset / linear / or just set up 4 different styles
(1 for each with no commas)

or you cn be more specific going for:

	border-top-style: dotted;

or just go for the shorthand: 

	border: 5px solid red;

width, type color. and we can do this with singular borders.

	p {
	  border-left: 6px solid red;
	  background-color: lightgrey;
	}

	border-radius: 5px;

and in case you want round angles.
and then: 

	text-decoration: line-through;

about the text.

	text-indent: 50px;

about space for the first line of text.

	letter-spacing: 3px;

	line-height: 0.8;

about how the letters will space in line and height.

	text-shadow: 2px 1px red;

and about a second layer to the text, with x, y and color.

how to use :before and :after, 
so, the :before selector (which can go with 2 :), 
is just elements to put before each time the selector is used...

so if we want to create a background image on a text just.

	.showcase:before {
	  content: '';
	  background: url('../assets/bdd.png') no-repeat center center/cover;
	  position: absolute;
	  z-index: -1;
	}

anyway , we set the index negative, and absolute vs the relative of the element inside of
it, and the background with the other properties.

coz the text inside:

	.showcase .showcase-inner {
	  display: flex;
	  flex-direction: column;
	  align-items: center;
	  justify-content: center;
	  text-align: center;
	  height: 100%;
	}

we set the height to get the content at center, with also the class container. 
then we set the opener as:

	.menu-wrap {
	  position: fixed;
	  top: 0;
	  left: 0;
	  z-index: 1;
	}

and we set the toggler (which we will use to see if the box is cheked)
as invisible (opacity 0):

	.menu-wrap .toggler {
	  position: absolute;
	  top: 80px;
	  left: 0;
	  z-index: 2;
	  cursor: pointer;
	  width: 50px;
	  height: 50px;
	  opacity: 0;
	}

ok so lets see.
we create a single line inside the div / div element 

	.menu-wrap .hamburger > div {
	  position: relative;
	  flex: none;
	  width: 100%;
	  height: 2px;
	  background: #fff;
	  display: flex;
	  align-items: center;
	  justify-content: center;
	  transition: all 0.4s ease;
	}

we use the > to target the div tag inside of itand this works even out of the scoped css.
and then we copy paste it more times....

	.menu-wrap .hamburger > div::before,
	.menu-wrap .hamburger > div::after {
	  content: '';
	  position: absolute;
	  z-index: 1;
	  top: -10px;
	  width: 100%;
	  height: 2px;
	  background: red;
	}

and we do it again later...

	.menu-wrap .hamburger > div::after {
	  top: 10px;
	}

ok and also the > is referred to all the direct children of the selector
(so no further children), 
and in the + case it will fiish with the first element (open, close)
to then go for the second. immediatly and only.

	.menu-wrap .toggler:checked + .hamburger > div {
	  transform: rotate(135deg);
	}

so I guess we here use it like an if statement, if the toggler is checked.
we go for the content and rotate it...

	.menu-wrap .toggler:checked + .hamburger > div {
	  transform: rotate(135deg);
	}

	.menu-wrap .toggler:checked + .hamburger > div:before,
	.menu-wrap .toggler:checked + .hamburger > div:after {
	  top: 0;
	  transform: rotate(90deg);
	}

ok so, these 2, we target different elements, in the first we go for the first
and the original line, and for the second, we rotate the other elements
so to create a cross.
I guess the 2 become one coz they dont have any top: difference like we
put before...

	.menu-wrap .toggler:checked:hover + .hamburger > div {
	  transform: rotate(225deg);
	}

and we add more flare with the hoven to rotate even more..
I guess the togler is connected to the menu being clicked so

	.menu-wrap .menu {
	  position: fixed;
	  top: 0;
	  left: 0;
	  width: 100%;
	  height: 100%;
	  visibility: hidden;
	  overflow: hidden;
	  display: flex;
	  align-items: center;
	  justify-content: center;
	}

with the position fixed, and the x / y setted to cover the entire page
(the rest is for the text that is inside of it)

the structure we build gives us some div tags to use for style so:

	.menu-wrap .menu > div {
	  background: rgba(24, 39, 51 , 0.85);
	  border-radius: 50%;
	  width: 200vw;
	  height: 200vw;
	  display: flex;
	  flex: none;
	  align-items: center;
	  justify-content: center;
	  transform: scale(0);
	  transition: all 0.4s ease;
	}

here we set the css for the container of the elemens after opening
the menu.

	.menu-wrap .menu > div > div {
	  text-align: center;
	  max-width: 90vw;
	  max-height: 100vh;
	  opacity: 0;
	  transition: opacity 0.4s ease;
	}

this to more easily style the text inside of it.
I mean, it styles the how the elements are viewed.

	.menu-wrap .menu > div > div > ul > li {
	  list-style: none;
	  color: #fff;
	  font-size: 1.5rem;
	  padding: 1rem;
	}

and this is for the actuall text elements on it.
and then, considering they are all and we want them to be neutral:

	.menu-wrap .menu > div > div > ul > li > a {
	  color: inherit;
	  text-decoration: none;
	  transition: color 0.4s ease;
	}

to avoid having the blue link aspect (idk how the transition work .remuved)
and in order to make visible all of the menu we use.

	.menu-wrap .toggler:checked ~ .menu {
	  visibility: visible;
	}

we set the condition (so to say) to make the menu assume a certain
property.

	.menu-wrap .toggler:checked ~ .menu > div {
	  transform: scale(1);
	  transition-duration: 0.75s;
	}

and this si about hwo we are gonna show the content of the div after the image was
checked.

and the last is to check with what opacity are we gonna show the elements.

	.menu-wrap .toggler:checked ~ .menu > div > div {
	  opacity: 1;
	  transition:  opacity 0.4s ease 0.4s;
	}

we set what we wanna transition in (the opacity) referred to the elements inside the menu.

ok so, we now will see how to make an element to open without the hamburger.
anyway, to have all the page used without the limits of container, we can remuve it from
the app.vue and use it on the vue file it starts with..

so:

we dont need the menu-wrap class, considering we already have the elemet we want to open with
a click...

ok so, we need to check how did the css interpret the click on a hamburger as
a click on the toggler...

anyway, about the toggler, we state an input....
which is part of a form, and button is a part of it, like 
**form, input, textarea option**

	<input type="checkbox" id="html" value="HTML">
	<label for="html">HTML</label>

ok so, there is anything new here but, the label is used to add text to
the botton, and the **for** links it to the input tag.

ok the plan is simple, we create a a hamburger class / square that is visible only when
we click the toggler ( there are 2 of them, the botton and the toggler which will be in
a different place....)

anyway, if we want to use special codes to show icons in html just remember to end them
with a semi-colomn; https://www.w3schools.com/charsets/ref_utf_dingbats.asp
for example, &#10007;

ok ci siamo riusciti, intanto vorrei ricordare l utilizzo di, il tage
vue-btn , da vedere in futuro.

ok so, about the visibility and display properties, the first is just for 
the see, and the display remuves them altogheter.

ok so, now the ojective s to check the minumun we neeed to replicate the 
meechanism and how to hsow different arguments for different postblogs.

ok so I knwo that in v-for="(section, index), the index is a value created by us.
but we use section as the name of the folder...when was that decided...
the class="group" isint used.
lets go again check how a list rendering works...
and to find ways to isolate a certain section:

ok so, 

	<ul id="example-1">
	  <li v-for="item in items">
	    {{ item.message }}
	  </li>
	</ul>

in a simple structure, we just create the first, then the n has to exist as 
the name of the container, and each . as something inside of it.


	var example1 = new Vue({
	  el: '#example-1',
	  data: {
	    items: [
	      { message: 'Foo' },
	      { message: 'Bar' }
	    ]
	  }
	})

ok so, we created both section and indes... but how does Object.keys(entries)
take the name of the single array?...
where is entries set?.
or maybe is the object.keys and we just work with it with the name entries...

finally the:

	<ul id="example-2">
	  <li v-for="(item, index) in items">
	    {{ parentMessage }} - {{ index }} - {{ item.message }}
	  </li>
	</ul>

index is just the number order in which the element is set.

I can find entries in the export part:

	  computed: {
	    entries() {
	      return Blogs
	    }
	  },

ok so, lets imagine a simple object.

	data() {
	  return {
	    objectItems: {
	      key1: 'item1' [],
	      key2: 'item 2' [],
	      key3: 'item3' []
	    }
	  }
	}

and in our current structure this would be like if each key1 is a folder
(considering we just get 1 {} and any key1 element is just an array with data on them)
ALSO our object doest have a name.

	<ul>
	  <li v-for="item in objectItems">{{ item }}</li>
	</ul>

with this we simply render the entirety of 1 item1[] with no data suddivision.
or do we?, coz considering the scructure 

    "Primo": [
        {
            "id": "",
            "date": "",
            "title": "",
            "description": ""
        },

we in theory should first create an array that includes only the first values (just the "title")
of the object, also, we arent referring anything inside the object (item doesnt exist)
so it proceeds alone in a order...

we have the paramethers. key and index...index is just the number..
and the item gives use the cntent of each element ( so in our strcuture it referes only to the 
[] not the name )

	<ul>
	  <li v-for="(item, key, index) in objectItems">
	    {{ item }} - {{ key }} - {{ index }}
	  </li>
	</ul>

considering none of these exist in the object, 
and 'key' gives us, the name of the elements inside of it, properties key
(the "primo" without )

so in our sistem we have index but... we use section instead, 

about the key to give some order:

	:key="index"

to allow us to track each element with an unique value we use the:

	<ul>
	  <li v-for="item in shoppingItems" :key="item.name">
	    {{ item.name }} - {{ item.price }}
	  </li>
	</ul>

which I guess helps us locate better each element / content.

we dont do the same considering the :key="index" is not used but section instead.

computed can be used to filtr the valus inside an object?
how did we use it?

	<ul>
	  <li v-for="item in itemsLessThanTen" :key="item.name">
	    {{ item.name }} - {{ item.price }}
	  </li>
	</ul>

we simply use a function to create a new array under a specific function
(which we then use in the v-for)

	data() {
	  return {
	    shoppingItems: [
	      {name: 'apple', price: '7'},
	      {name: 'orange', price: '12'}
	    ]
	  }
	},
	computed:{
	  itemsLessThanTen: function() {
	    return this.shoppingItems.filter(function(item) {
	      return item.price > 10;
	    })
	  }
	}

this is a different type of data outside the data.....

and we export it.....

or we can use a method...

	<ul>
	  <li v-for="item in filterItems(shoppingItems)" :key="item.name">
	    {{ item.name }} - {{ item.price }}
	  </li>
	</ul>

here the in object is slitly more complicated...

	data() {
	  return {
	    shoppingItems: [
	      {name: 'apple', price: '7'},
	      {name: 'orange', price: '12'}
	    ]
	  }
	},
	methods:{
	  filterItems: function(items) {
	    return items.filter(function(item) {
	      return item.price > 10;
	    })
	  }
	}

but I guess we could introduce another method considering our one doesnt change it.

computed is a property, anyway the difference between it and method is that
computed will not re-run if it re-loaded but only if its reactive component is
changed, 

ok It seems I have to use computed properties, I should check if its possible 
to just indicate the element I want to show in the v-for tag or something..
(retaining the click method I guess)

use the iteration of v-for on a object (we will search ways to just include)
anyway when we tried to do this we got the need to get a :key on our

    <div v-for="Value in Primo" :key="Value">
      <h3>{{Value}}</h3>

the problem here is that we cannot make work both Primo nor Blog
(even if imported) coz we just referenze them..

he used Object.keys(entries), 

ok so, we need 2 pieces of data: we know how Object.keys(entries)
works, with that we can work with the object but iterating with
a v-for will return all the values and we want just 1, also we need to know
how exactly works.

ok so, lets concentrate on how the **computed property**
works:

	export default {
	  name: 'contact',
	  computed: {
	    entries() {
	      return Blogs
	    }
	  }
	 }

its used to output data, to return it.

	<template>
	  <p>{{ count }}</p>
	</template>

	<script>
	export default {
	  data() {
	    return {
	      count: 1
	    }
	  }
	}

the function we want to replicate is.
ok so, we want to **modify** and logic compute over the value used.
in this case {{ count * 10 }}, 

but its limited and to avoid getting confusing, 
so we:

	export default {
	  computed: {
	  }
	}

thats how we define it.

ok so, lets check an example:

	<template>
	  <p>{{ count }}</p>
	</template>

we call it without the typical, count(). we invoke the
function immediantly, 

	<script>
	export default {
	  data() {
	    return {
	      items: [1, 2, 3]
	    }
	  },

we just return the array we wanna work with

	  computed: {
	    count: function() {
	      return 'The count is ' + this.items.length * 10
	    }
	  }
	}
	</script>

ok so, we use a simple function, and the return gives us the entire package.
we use .this, referred to our array.

but now I am still asking myself what does:

	    entries() {
	      return Blogs
	    }

do, I mean, it could create an array with all the elements of the object...
(considering that blog is how we imported it, in its totality)

the differece with methods is simple, if you need to call a method you need to
be **called** not just referenced.

	v-on:click="navigate()"

with this syntax. anyway it seems that the computed properties
are cached, so it will be refreshed/changed, only if the
elements inside the items array change. 

also depends of the type of function you put on it, if its reactive it
will set once and done.
like:

	export default {
	  computed: {
	    now: function () {
	      return Date.now()
	    }
	  }
	}

ok so, we finally were able to use v-if creating an empty div.

    <div v-for="Primo in Object.keys(entries)" :key="Primo">
      <div v-if="Primo === 'Primo'">
        <h3>{{Primo}}</h3>
      </div>
    </div>

ok so, if we simply wanna use a value we can add the computed:

	    date() {
	      return Object.keys(Blogs)[0];
	    }

and then use it as:

	<h3>lets see {{date}}</h3>

anyway to keep a record just keep this in mind:

	New Vue({
	  el: '#app',
	  
	  data: {
	    x: {
	      "2018-05-11": {
	        "may": 4,
	        "june": 8,
	        "april": 5
	      }
	    }
	  },
	  computed: {
	    date() {
	      return Object.keys(this.x)[0];
	    }
	  }
	});

ok so, we target the element with the id, we create an array and a given name
and to actually compute over it we use the (this.x) (in our case we used the imported Blogs)

	<div id="app">
	  <p>My date is {{date}}</p>
	</div>

here we just get the id.

anyway here we **displayed key values**
some more examples about getting the values:

	new Vue({
	  template: `
	    <ul>
	      <li v-for="(value, key) in object">{{ key }}: {{ value }} </li>
	    </ul>
	  `,
	  

like always , we create a v-for with both values created, but referring to a **object**
I remember that value,key and index as set values for the vue.

	  data: () => {
	    return {
	      object: {
	        key1: 'value1',
	        key2: 'value2',
	        key3: 'value3',
	      },
	    };
	  },
	}).$mount('#root');

in theory you should get just the name of the array/ or element of the object, correctly.

ok so, the idea is to add conditional statement to our v-for loops
(which mean filter), 

anyway as a computed property we are gonna create a subset of our object.
ok so, .filter() is not usable in this situation coz it works only on arrays.

on objects:

anyway we already know how:

    <div v-for="Primo in Object.keys(entries)" :key="Primo">
      <div v-if="Primo === 'Primo'">
        <h3>{{Primo}}</h3>
      </div>
    </div>

is not effective:

ok so, we already have the element we targeted, now we need to get to the values within,
this time with a correct loop.

I dont know if changing data from sections, 

        <div class="section" v-for="entry in entries[data]" :key="entry.id">
          <div class="entry">
            <h3 @click="$router.push({name: entry.id})">
              {{entry.title}}
              <span class="subtitle">:{{entry.date}}</span>
            </h3>
            <p class="resto">{{entry.description}}</p>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

anyway it seems it works. of course I will have to do this for any new page with a new argument
and also use 2 compute functions.

ok so, I have what I need but now I have to check how to use boostrap to
get a better nabvar / a modal for the gallery / maybe a video player and finally a way to get 
my contacts in a page.

ok so, what we did was an example of frontend development, on a modern web 
framework, anyway somethng exist called ButterCMS . idk yet.
like I was thiking that html and markdown had the mark i common.
lightweight markup language (remember the m in html, mark language)

anyway we get a webpack loader to get to write post in markdown( to be then
used in vue)

then you get a vue markdown loader.

anyway boostrap front-end framework.
for html, css and responsive designs.

ok so, if we want to use boostrap we need to use containers for the elements
and if we want to avoid getting corners we just divide between:

.container / .containers-fluid

ok so, about the metadata in vue (considering that creating a head in app)
didnt worked out.

anyway we see that vue doesnt always want to mess with head and body tags.

ok so, we are trying to use npm i vue-headful
I hope we dont have to mess up too much with the components...

we added a Vue.component('vue-headful', vueHeadful);
in our app / I still have to check the differences between that and
the vue.use (considering both are packages I used)

AND also, I have to check the documentation and see what I will need 
to knwo so I use boostrap...kinda,

ok so, we cant go copy and paste, the tags but we just have to use a differet type of 
ok so, about what we will need from now on:

even if there is some documentation on how to add certain type of head data
(like all the meta and content)
I have to see if I will need to use some specific meta tags.

(anyway about the question from before, we aleady have the boostrap script nd meta stuff)
I guess It was installed with boot or vue 

ok so lets see.

ok so, its the bg-primary which sets the color, and if I want a different one I can just
style="background-color: #e3f2fd;"

ok so, about the classes to put in the, "navbar navbar-expand-lg fixed-top navbar-dark"
the fixed top I guess helps us ignore the space that can be set in the css
and the navbar-dark helps us to set the tet in the navbar as white (while light
set it as black)

we can use a tags to set up a navbar-brand
and... it seems that, to equilibrate the position of both brand and
nav options we go to the class ml-auto" for the ul tag
ok so, lets study a bit of code to set the padding / margin.

ok so, if you want borders (of the same color of the pre set navbar-dark)
we can play a bit with the colors and borders but there isnt a lot morte I need to add.

ok so, it seems that, I can use flexbos to manipulate element position on both
the axis X and Y. and we need a flexbos to be able to justify content.
ok so, it seems that auto is used to push items both right and left.

and yeah the span class with the sr-only class is just for info to get
for only readers I guess.

used for screen readers. anyway text to speach for no view.
and w keep the tag with {current}.

classes .small if you want it more compct or .lead to stand out
you can manipulate the style with classes without too much css.
or a more direct display-1/4

ok so, a bit of background on nav, responsive meta components, which we use as navigation
headers.

and like we did before we get the active class.

anyway here a skeleton to build a dropdown menu.

    <li class="dropdown">
        <a href="#" class="dropdown-toggle" data-toggle="dropdown" role="button" aria-haspopup="true" aria-expanded="false">Dropdown
            <span class="caret"></span>
        </a>
        <ul class="dropdown-menu">
            <li><a href="#">Action</a></li>
            <li><a href="#">Another action</a></li>
            <li><a href="#">Something else here</a></li>
            <li><a href="#">Separated link</a></li>
            <li><a href="#">One more separated link</a></li>
        </ul>
    </li>

and you can see the classes needed here.

	<form action="#" class="navbar-form">
	    <div class="form-group">
	        <label for="search-input" class="sr-only">search</label>
	        <input type="text" id="search-input" class="form-control" placeholder="Search">
	        <button type="submit" class="btn btn-default">Submit</button>
	    </div>
	</form>    

and we need to search a way to set the search and input in the same line.

anyway you can also set the position of the navbar with some classes.
.navbar-fixed-top, and if you wanna locate parts of the navbar just.

anyway we seem to have some problems in loading the image but in case of problems just remember
the native padding for the brand is 15 px, you can set it to 0

	.navbar-brand {
	    padding: 0;
	}

and transfer it to the image I guess

	.navbar-brand  >img {
	    padding: 15px;  // this value is optional, increasing or decreasing it is up to you.
	    height: 100%;
	} 

anyway remember about the flex to keep them in order
display: flex and the align-items: center.

ok so, if we need to modify the height we can:

	.navbar {
	    min-height: 80px;
	}

	.navbar-brand {
	    padding: 0 15px;
	    height: 80px;
	    line-height: 80px;
	}

	.navbar-toggle {
	    /* (80px - button height 34px) / 2 = 23px */
	    margin-top: 23px;
	    padding: 9px 10px ;
	}
	@media (min-width: 768px) {
	    .navbar-nav > li > a {
	        /* (80px - line-height of 27px) / 2 = 26.5px */
	        padding-top: 26.5px;
	        padding-bottom: 26.5px;
	        line-height: 27px;
	    }
	}   

setting the height with css, and controlling how it happears with a media
(on the creen size)

ok so, boostrap doesnt have a icon library.

anyway I can save and modify icons with my gimp editor tho, saving some to
take them later.

anyway I downloaded 2 packs of icons in the documents folder.

anyway at the moment I am not so pressed (learn how to use SVG files tho)

ok so, the idea is, to have not only the index name but also a linked image.
(I have in mind a solution which allow us to search the number/index)
in case its too many.

well it seems you just had to set the form-inline class
(in case you want to set them in the same line)

	  <form class="form-inline">
	    <input class="form-control mr-sm-2" type="search" placeholder="Search" aria-label="Search">
	    <button class="btn btn-outline-warning my-2 my-sm-0" type="submit">Search</button>
	  </form>

and it works.
and, you can add a lighter version of the form here:

	  <form class="form-inline">
	    <div class="input-group">
	      <div class="input-group-prepend">
	        <span class="input-group-text" id="basic-addon1">@</span>
	      </div>
	      <input type="text" class="form-control" placeholder="Username" aria-label="Username" aria-describedby="basic-addon1">
	    </div>
	  </form>

you can define the volume of a button with btn.sm/md/lg

ok so, here you can see a prototype of a toggle which hides from the start 
the values between I guess.

	<div class="pos-f-t">
	  <div class="collapse" id="navbarToggleExternalContent">
	    <div class="bg-dark p-4">
	      <h4 class="text-white">Collapsed content</h4>
	      <span class="text-muted">Toggleable via the navbar brand.</span>
	    </div>
	  </div>
	  <nav class="navbar navbar-dark bg-dark">
	    <button class="navbar-toggler" type="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#navbarToggleExternalContent" aria-controls="navbarToggleExternalContent" aria-expanded="false" aria-label="Toggle navigation">
	      <span class="navbar-toggler-icon"></span>
	    </button>
	  </nav>
	</div>

ok putting mobirise on the D.

ok so, if we want to use a cross button:

	<button type="button" class="close btn-primary" aria-label="Close">
	  <span aria-hidden="true">&times;</span>
	</button>

I mean the real crossis the &times BUT with the other code we get an oven effect

ok emmm, just nothing, a empty with a center search and icon.

            <div class="row d-flex justify-content-center">
              <div class="col-md-8">
                <form action="#">
                  <div class="form-group">
                    <input type="search" name="search" id="search" placeholder="What are you looking for?">
                    <button type="submit" class="submit"><i class="icon-search-1"></i></button>
                  </div>
                </form>
              </div>
            </div>

ok so, we get image background and icon again.
anyway it seems that we can only use the css to give tags certain backgrounds.
anyway we have to check classes

	background: url(img/gallery-2.jpg); background-size: cover; background-position: center center

its kinda simple I have to check how we did that in our case.

we get a footer for the little data I guess:

anyway check how th footer tag works.

ok so, if we want a template for image and comment text:

ok so, we still use the row, and some classes, I should find a way to set the folders here.
ok so, here we just get some class for the overlay with the icon.

if you want an icon for contact just put an icon with the link.
here some code.

	<li class="list-inline-item"><a href="#"><i class="fa fa-facebook"></i></a></li>

we just have to load images on top of them (maybe added in the json file)

and we need some help for the pagnantion maybe (that on the list of blogs articles)

ok so, about the task of naming the content pag with the arguments down there...
I mean its not so important I can hard code it... but where do they take me?

do I have to build a page (not view in the navbar) which contains only the 
articles of a certain argument?.... well with minimal styling but...
each post would need an image (but I guess I can put it there with markdown no?
instead of putting it in the json, also I should find some extension for that)

I can even set a specific route for each of the said arguments.
without needing to rool over the jason file

I already have the footer redy and the icons

I have to check how the past blog list was,maybe I can gve each new colors...

also the footer should be set in the app.vue.

anyway: ok..

we got our templates we can scrapt elements from BUT. for now we are gonna create an
ordered and not styled version of the mechanism (trigng to get the style for
at least the bog list) and then we are gonna use the templates we got.

comincieremo con 4 argomenti (con rispettivi routes immagini e mezzo style)

ok in the html page we check the content and the classes.

ok so, it seems that I forgot but we can use ./assets/.png
I mean remember the ./ even if its in the same folder.

anyway it seems that we are using the display: flex to put them inline
(I should check the bootstrap class for that)

list-style none is to avoid getting thoese dots
text-align to get the text ordered below the icons
and display: block....

and like always we set the text-decoration none to remuve the 
link aspect.(kinda, just the underline)

ok so, it seems that display block kinda, mekes the spces full or something.
anyway lets see how to use another pseudo class.

:last-child (which allow us to remuve the extra border-right we dont need)
.border-right: none;

anyway, we set the overflow to hidde (even if I dont know to what it referes)
considering the icon.

ok so, it seems that the fontawesome icons can be modyfied as text
by the css (like font-size and color)
by selecting the .fa class on them.

oh yeah, I was able to load an external script src to the vue file app.vue
how?, 

npm install vue-script2 --save

import VS2 from 'vue-script2'
Vue.use(VS2)

and to finish

	<script2 src="https://kit.fontawesome.com/f107dae9c2.js"></script2>

anyway, talking about how to make a selector go for different classes.

	.test li a .icon .far, .fas {
	  width: 100%;
	  color: red;
	}

anyway, we use the , to set the other classes (in this case with all the previous)
path to which aply the values.

also in case you set 2 images icons togheter (even if they still continue being lined)
use 

	width:100%
(anyway we also use height 100% to get the space between to scale from)

ok so, apart from each other elements we use the:

	line-height: 40px;

property, and adds space under and up the element (double margin?)

anyway we modify the font-size of the icons (we actually can do it)

also for the transitionY we used the value 100%.

and also, to get a change in color and avoiding using too much code
we just set a pseudo class to target it.
which will help us get that:

	.test li a:hover .icon .fas:last-child{
	  color: blue;
	}

ok then I will have to check how width doesnt change for the class .name

ok so, we set the transition time on the span tag we created for the div tag name
(in which we also create a text-data file)

hey m8, get redy fro a little nuke, it seems that 
**font-weight** can be expressed trought code of set numbers.
just from 400 to 900.

anyway, if we talk about 

	text-align: 

it works not only in text but for all (inline/ inline-block) elements

**anyway talkingabout a specific navbar:**

so, about how to set an image as entire background.
but first lets see how does the web-lit extencion work for the
css part. 

ok so, to have a background fixed and complete just.
ok so, lets see how to apply the gradient here.

also we should be able to switch font family with a simple selector on it.
ok so.look at this, (all boostrap): for a centered looking navbar:

anyway remember to use the mx-auto.

anyway I still didnt got how is the clearfix supposed to be used BUT.
about the position of these more free set ups 

anyway for the image and text dimension we have this media query.

anyway the boostrap codes go from 1 to 5.
and add **text-center** between the classes in boostrap

anyway, I have to check out the bootstrap code and, the relative position of the element.

anyway if we put a color behind a class which comes before the container
it will cover all the width.

and if you wanted to get the double border color just go to.

and here the complete section

we also have the class **img-fluid** 

anyway not a lot new here, it re uses the tranparency, and we still need to
go deeper for ther boostrap classes. 
anyway if you want some classes you can check here.

having set each spacig for a page organized in section is kinda nice.

for the image is thanks to the img-fluid that we are able to controll
any image to the page.

anyway for the page with the interesting setting and position just remember

	mr-auto and ml-auto.

anyway if more interested in the elements here:

here the template with all the bootstrap.

ok so, in our case the use the p- class to set the various sections of the page
close to each other, anyway in our little gallery we get to
put the elements close to each other with.

	.no-gutters {
	  margin-right: 0;
	  margin-left: 0;
	}

	.no-gutters > .col,
	.no-gutters > [class*="col-"] {
	  padding-right: 0;
	  padding-left: 0;
	}

ok so, about the gradient here we can see it a little better.
to get the text and back going.

	.masthead h1 {
	  font-family: 'Varela Round';
	  font-size: 2.5rem;
	  line-height: 2.5rem;
	  letter-spacing: 0.8rem;
	  background: -webkit-linear-gradient(rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.9), rgba(255, 255, 255, 0));
	  -webkit-text-fill-color: transparent;
	  -webkit-background-clip: text;
	}

adding a little color on the text next to an image is kinda ez.

	 .projects-section .featured-text {
	    padding: 0 0 0 2rem;
	    border-left: 0.5rem solid #64a19d;
	 }

ok so, we need to search how to build captions /carousel

ok so, lets go for te **Home.vue page**.

     <h1>{{ texto }}</h1>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-4 col-lg4" v-for="(data,index) in gallery" :key="index">

        <img :src="data.image" class="img-fluid">
        <h3 v-on:click="goTodetail(data.galleryId)">{{ data.prompt }} sample</h3>
      </div>
    </div>

  data () {
    return {
      texto: 'welcome to the BloGk',
      gallery: [
        {
          prompt: 'lets try the movement',
          image: require('../assets/case.jpg'),
          galleryId:1
        },
      ]
    }
  },

 ok so, here we presented how we manage to do the various exercises on how
 to work with vue. the loop we created up there, uses the index key to order the 
 elements present in the object/array we are using.

then we target what we are using with, :src="" with the first term (data,index)
which rappresent the object we stored in the sript, (and having index just created by us)

and to use a method:

	    <h3 v-on:click="goTodetail(data.galleryId)">{{ data.prompt }} sample</h3>

we created a method on the script part of the file.

	methods:{
	  goTodetail(proId) {
	    this.$router.push({name:'details',params:{Pid:proId}})
	 }
	}

we transfer on it the element we taken from the data object and use it to push.
where? well we already set a route with a name and the data it uses will be.
transfered with a new name.

here we get more of the same.

	<div class="col-md-2" v-for="(product,index) in gallery" :key="index">
	 <div v-if="proId == product.galleryId">
	  <p>{{product.prompt}}</p>
	  <img :src="product.image" class="img-fluid">
	 </div>
	</div>
	<h3>{{title}}:{{ proId }}</h3>
	</div>

we re-work on a object/array, (in this case with product) in gallery(whic is the name
of the array/object), setting v-if inside a v-for is not optimal tho.

anyway we target with the same mechanism from before, and we use the value we transfered from before

	  data(){
	   return{
	    proId: this.$route.params.Pid,
	    title: " how could I use another window with an image from a gallery and a number attached to it?",
	    gallery: [
	        {
	          prompt: 'sample image',
	          image: require('../assets/case.jpg'),
	          galleryId:1
	        },
	      ]
	   }
	  },

not a lot to say, we change the anme of the value we used, I mean, we....
target it now, with:

**this.$router.**push({name:'details',**params**:{**Pid**:proId}})

anyway,we just give it back its old name.
and we prit it to our template.

then in the router part you write it down as.

      {path: '/details/:Pid', name: 'details',component: forth},

and after deleting both the route and the component import on the routes.js we check the css.

but first lets go check the bootstrap data so maybe we can save some code with the
classes.

for example:
** .img-thumbnail ** as a class get the image 1px, roud corners. or also **rounded**
nothing new. ** float-right float-left ** and **mx-auto d-block**
to set the images to the right and to the left or the the center (even if I dont know
how the d-block class works.) or also use the **text-center** class.

also it seems that the tag picture acts different from img...

	.home{
	  margin-top: 60px;
	  position: relative;
	  width: 100%;
	  height: auto;
	  /*min-height: 30rem;*/
		padding: 1rem 0;
		background: linear-gradient(to bottom right, rgba(100, 40, 180, 0.3) 0%, rgba(180, 52, 60, 0.7) 75%, rgba(200,8,21, 0.5) 100%), url("../assets/case.jpg");
		background-attachment: fixed;
	  background-position: center;
	  background-size: cover;
	}

I have to check the difference between them and maybe check the differences between 
position: absolute and relative.

ok so, lets go check the construct for the front page.

    <div class="menu-wrap">
        <input type="checkbox" class="toggler">
        <div class="hamburger">
          <div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="menu">
        <div>
            <div>

              <ul>
                  <li><a href="#">Home</a></li>
                  <li><a href="#">About</a></li>
                  <li><a href="#">Services</a></li>
                  <li><a href="#">Contact</a></li>
              </ul>

            </div>
        </div>
        </div>
    </div>

we can see that, we wrap a checkbox and a toggler under the botton.
we give the botton the class and set the space in which it is.

and inside menu we also have the text of the menu options.
and cheking out the classes on it:

we set up the botton in the css:

	.menu-wrap {
	  position: fixed;
	  top: 50px;
	  left: 0;
	  z-index: 1;
	}

then we style the toggler a bit and make it invisible:

	.menu-wrap .toggler {
	  position: absolute;
	  top: 0;
	  left: 0;
	  z-index: 2;
	  cursor: pointer;
	  width: 50px;
	  height: 50px;
	  opacity: 0;
	}

-menu-swap refers to all the toglle/botton and it seems that there is no 
difference between fixed and absolute.

here we set the square:

	.menu-wrap .hamburger {
	  position: absolute;
	  top: 0;
	  left: 0;
	  z-index: 1;
	  width: 60px;
	  height: 60px;
	  padding: 1rem;
	  background: var(--primary-color);
	  display: flex;
	  align-items: center;
	  justify-content: center;
	}

or better, the elements inside of it.

and, even If I think I could get the same with a icon.

	.menu-wrap .hamburger > div {
	  position: relative;
	  flex: none;
	  width: 100%;
	  height: 2px;
	  background: #fff;
	  display: flex;
	  align-items: center;
	  justify-content: center;
	  transition: all 0.4s ease;
	}

	.menu-wrap .hamburger > div::before,
	.menu-wrap .hamburger > div::after {
	  content: '';
	  position: absolute;
	  z-index: 1;
	  top: -10px;
	  width: 100%;
	  height: 2px;
	  background: inherit;
	}

ok so, with the first we create the singe line, which occupy all the parent tag.
and there we set the animation time I guess.

then we multiply it with the :before, :after pseudoclass, 
and we give them a same top in px, AND, we add another.

	.menu-wrap .hamburger > div::after {
	  top: 10px;
	}

to get the down there too,
and then we get to the animation (using the :checked as an if condition)

.menu-wrap .toggler:checked + .hamburger > div {
  transform: rotate(135deg);
}

.menu-wrap .toggler:checked + .hamburger > div:before,
.menu-wrap .toggler:checked + .hamburger > div:after {
  top: 0;
  transform: rotate(90deg);
}

.menu-wrap .toggler:checked:hover + .hamburger > div {
  transform: rotate(225deg);
}

to get a cross and then some.

and here is where we set the visibility...of the menu....

	.menu-wrap .toggler:checked ~ .menu {
	  visibility: visible;
	}

which was set to hidden in the orginal class which defined it
(and again the :cheked as a if statement class.)

	.menu-wrap .menu {
	  position: fixed;
	  top: 0;
	  left: 0;
	  width: 100%;
	  height: 100%;
	  visibility: hidden;
	  overflow: hidden;
	  display: flex;
	  align-items: center;
	  justify-content: center;
	}

here we set some specific of how I want to be displayed the
menu after a click

	.menu-wrap .toggler:checked ~ .menu > div {
	  transform: scale(1);
	  transition-duration: var(--menu-speed);
	}

(just for animation and scale of menu elements)

	.menu-wrap .toggler:checked ~ .menu > div > div {
	  opacity: 1;
	  transition:  opacity 0.4s ease 0.4s;
	}

like we saw before we set 2 div tags in the menu elements
here we specify the background of the menu section

	.menu-wrap .menu > div {
	  background: var(--overlay-color);
	  border-radius: 50%;
	  width: 200vw;
	  height: 200vw;
	  display: flex;
	  flex: none;
	  align-items: center;
	  justify-content: center;
	  transform: scale(0);
	  transition: all 0.4s ease;
	}

ok so, this, still not sure what we used the opacity for
and here we.....

	.menu-wrap .menu > div > div {
	  text-align: center;
	  max-width: 90vw;
	  max-height: 100vh;
	  opacity: 0;
	  transition: opacity 0.4s ease;
	}

anyway we remuved it wothout much problems....

	.menu-wrap .menu > div > div > ul > li {
	  list-style: none;
	  color: #fff;
	  font-size: 1.5rem;
	  padding: 1rem;
	}

ok so, the elements get these values on them

ok so, there are some classes I should put in the app.vue if I want to 
style the navbar

ok so, lets see whats different in how we set a baclground.

not a lot kinda, there is not z-ndex: -1... I still dont know if due to the
pact that there was ...

      gallery: [
        {
          prompt: 'lets try the movement',
          image: require('../assets/case.jpg'),
          galleryId:1
        },
      ]

this is the gallery we remuved in which we used a loop to get the value inside of it.

    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-4 col-lg-4" v-for="(data,index) in gallery" :key="index">
        <img :src="data.image" class="img-fluid rounded">
        <h3>{{ data.prompt }} sample</h3>
      </div>

      <div class="col-md-8">
        <h4>and the idea was to put a bit of description here</h4>
      </div>
    </div>

of course in case you wanna store the image data as 

ok so, analyzing the css I can see how we get stil get a class for the
.body and .container.

ok so, to try to use the selector 

	:display:

with **block** we ended up putting all the elements into a 
single line

and with **inline** I have kinda the same, plus we also fill the entire space with the
said elements, and ignore some properties. (like the margin, floats and width, height)

and **inline-flex** has some problems with the space definition
(it leaves me with a whte space in the bottom)

what **flex** does is 
"displays an element as a block-level flex container" 
I guess its a particolar form of container, and as "block-level"

anyway it seems that we are working with a flexible box layout...
and **flex-direction** which is a subset,
defining flex axis, ad how the items are displayed
(row (default) and columns (with the -reveverse in case you wanted to
get to the opposite border.))

and **align-items** is also a sub-property for the flex box.
and maybe we already set that with the boostrap considering we can see no 
differences.
anyway between the valous we can give to them we set the
flex-start and flex-end (which just setwhere we are gonna start building up
from base or from upper)
and, center tries to center, while stretch trues to fill
any colums with the element within.

what would be the difference between....

ok so, you first set the direction in which you want your elements to
be set on, then you set where in that direction you want them to happear.

flex-directin sets the row or column, and justify content how you wanna see them

like always flex-start and flex.end to get them on different sides.

then space-between gives a space for ay element and -around more spaces between
the singular elements.

and also we need to find a solution for how to avoid to get white space in case of
smaller screens.

ok so, the height doesnt set here the height of the elemenst of the 
showcase.inner BUT about its position.

and maybe we shoud check utilities.

ok so, the kinda of css we put in clearfix.

	@mixin clearfix() {
	  &::after {
	    display: block;
	    content: "";
	    clear: both;
	  }
	}

so we also included the display: flex which has inside the
clearfix which has block...

about the clear....
and it seems that clearfix is not needed?
anyway, we still have a problem for smaller screens.

also we remuved the laft-0 class on the intro-text

AND we also remuved the img-fluid.....
ok so, about the mb-number we can actually make it work
with mt- so its seems that we can actually modify it a bit, anyway.

anyway we have remuved the mb-3....

ok so, in mt-lg-3 formula we set the margin/padding with the direction,
then we set value of the said element.

anyway, we also remuved the mt-sm-5, 

it seems that for vue we need a plug in.... actually no
we can actually use it without prblems in the css.

ok so, considering that the text has set the position as absolute we can modify it.
so we do that in the...

anyway I have also to set the float of the nav bottom to the right.

ok so, we are gonna change the boostrap navbar with all teh style we got with the custom css.
ok so, we just changed the elmet inside the various 

and considering I am modifying the css elements of the navbar, 
and also we have to move the navbar-toggler to the right with a class.

also we use navbar-header to get the icon on the nav....anyway we put a navbar-brand inside of it
and the -header allow us to have a space completely responsive.

anyway here is the past version for a bordered and shodow version.

    display: inline-block;
    border-radius: 10px;
    box-shadow: 0 10px 30px black;

ok so, if you want to size of he icon just modify the 

    font-size: 28px;
    padding: 0 30px;

and we also regulate the space between just modifying the padding between elements.

ok so, the idea is to put the css to style data on the corrispective pages instead of the 
app.vue.

we also have a font-smoothing in the css, formulated after the webkit.

	-webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased;
	-moz-osx-font-smoothing: grayscale;

leaving it there to a more concise looking.
and also remember the text/bg-success/warning/secondary.

anyway we can create gradients with a boostrap class.
which is a linear color progression, 

ok so, it seems that to enable the gradient options we need to create and add a
scss file, so I will just stick with css I guess.

ok so, you can create a line of separation with the tag hr OR
try to create a semi square border with.

	<hr size="60">

referred to the y axis.

anyway still remember about the float-right/left for the elemets.
and we can also use the _display:none_,
in case we wanted to hide something with the media query.

in case you wanted to add multiple conditions.

	and (max-width: 900px) and (min-width: 600px)

or if you wanna put conditions:

	 and (min-width: 600px), (min-width: 1100px)

ok so, we can try to create a gallery with elements wraped between them:

	.row {
	  display: flex;
	  flex-wrap: wrap;
	  padding: 0 10px;
	}

	/* Create four equal columns that sits next to each other */
	.column {
	  flex: 25%;
	  max-width: 25%;
	  padding: 0 4px;
	}

	.column img {
	  margin-top: 8px;
	  vertical-align: middle;
	}

ok so I kinda wasted a bit of time on this but lets go, 
if we want to create 4 columns with images with different height we just need this
structure.

      <div class="row">
        <div class="column">
          <img :src="image1" style="width:100%">
        </div>
        <div class="column">
          <img :src="image1" style="width:100%">
        </div>
        <div class="column">
          <img :src="image1" style="width:100%">
        </div>
        <div class="column">
          <img :src="image1" style="width:100%">
        </div>
      </div>

	.row {
	  display: flex;
	  flex-wrap: wrap;
	  padding: 0 10px;
	}
	/* Create four equal columns that sits next to each other */
	.column {
	  flex: 25%;
	  max-width: 25%;
	  padding: 0 4px;
	}
	.column img {
	  margin-top: 8px;
	  vertical-align: middle;
	}
	@media screen and (max-width: 800px) {
	  .column {
	    flex: 50%;
	    max-width: 50%;
	  }
	}
	/* Responsive layout - makes the two columns stack on top of each other instead of next to each other */
	@media screen and (max-width: 600px) {
	  .column {
	    flex: 100%;
	    max-width: 100%;
	  }
	}

ok so, the idea behind is kinda simple, we create 4 column with width.
of 25% plus the specific impaginantion.

and also it doesnt work very well with the for loop.

ok so, we can also see how the flex: percentage
can indeed be used to do what we already do with the col-classes.

	<p class="text-left"></p>
	<p class="text-center"></p>
	<p class="text-right"></p

to set side of the text or also images.
ok so, if we want to give background to some text (I guess)
we can try the class text-wrap. to cover the entire elemnt
(badge here is used to give itthe color)

    <div class="badge badge-primary text-wrap" style="width: 6rem;">
      This text should wrap.  
    </div>

or the text-nowrap:

	<div class="text-nowrap bd-highlight" style="width: 8rem;">
	  This text should overflow the parent.
	</div>

here the highlight is stopped after the 8rem instead of being
covered all.

and if we want to transform the text we:

	<p class="text-lowercase">Lowercased text.</p>
	<p class="text-uppercase">Uppercased text.</p>
	<p class="text-capitalize">CapiTaliZed text.</p>

to have it directly in the tag.

	<p class="font-italic">Italic text.</p>
	<p class="font-weight-bold">Bold text.</p>
	<p class="font-weight-light">Light weight text.</p>

and this for changing the font.
or just:

	font-monospace.

ok so, this works if you want to remuve the decoration from a link or etc.

	<a href="#" class="text-decoration-none">Non-underlined link</a>

and this for the color that its inheried from the parent class.

	<p class="text-muted">
	  Muted text with a <a href="#" class="text-reset">reset link</a>.
	</p>

ok so, the idea is to have a wide image as logo with a lighter text 
square on the down side.

ok so, if you want to modify the heigh and width based on the parent tag in which it is
in, anyway the syntax go for 

	h-0/100 and w-0/100

and its based on the parent tag.
anyway I wanted to add that you cannot modify ay native h/w but just
it s proportional.

anyway to get the responsive aspect of our element and we want to deal with the
Extra small just go for col-

and it seems that col-something-auto adaps the space remainnet between others

ok so, if you want no space between elements (ins9ide a row I guess
considering the col- spaces of the column)

	<div class="row no-gutters">

anyway in the text we have inside of it.
ok so, if I wanna impost a flex class into
the tag we start with:

	.d-inline-flex .d-flex

ok so, we get to the justify-content- class
to see where to set different and it sets the space between 
the various elements and the borders, kinda.

	justify-content-center, justify-content-between, justify-content-around

ok so, the first sets the elements inside the _center_ while the
_between_ is for getting them separated with spaces while the _around_
is similar to the latter but incldes spcases for the borders too.

ok so the different white spaces for the text are relative in position AND
with a negative margin to intertwine in the image.

ok so, considering we have 3 elements and we just want one of them to go to the 
background we set the z-index to 0 and the other 2
(which can be in different places in the html), to z-index 1

ok so, we uset he ml-auto, anyway from the image classes
we remuved, anyway we also need to check how
to get some responsive class.

anyway we can let some text stand out more with the 

	class="lead"

anyway if we want more tags we can also use.

	em, small, strong, u, del

the last 2 are for the underlined and the deleted one.
and also we can work with the <b> tag for having a 
strong text but not bigger.

	<abbr title="smaller texto">like</abbr>

ok so with this we can get some specific text abreviated with
the simple hoven and a undeline dotted.

	<footer class="blockquote-footer">Someone famous in 
		<cite title="Source Title">
			Source Title
		</cite>
	</footer>

ok so, we get the cite with a bit of line to set the source with
a specific title with the hoven (even if not the cursor element)

and if you want to focus a certain element about how to align items.

	align-self-start

anyway if we want to have content to align items in the height element we
use the:

	align-content-start

ok so, it seems we can see some responsive behavior of the text if we give it the 
classes for the h text, 

ok so, we can work with offset and margins to work with the columns.
anyway we can set blank space inside the row, 
the syntax works like this.

	<div class="col-md-6 offset-md-4">

and it sets space before the element, the remaining sopace is giving
for granted.

ok so, if you want to customize your row you can next the colums with a
premade.

	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-md-X">

and then below another row.

anyway if you want to know some data to set some width or media query:

	$grid-columns:      12;
	$grid-gutter-width: 30px;

	$grid-breakpoints: (
	  // Extra small screen / phone
	  xs: 0,
	  // Small screen / phone
	  sm: 576px,
	  // Medium screen / tablet
	  md: 768px,
	  // Large screen / desktop
	  lg: 992px,
	  // Extra large screen / wide desktop
	  xl: 1200px
	);

	$container-max-widths: (
	  sm: 540px,
	  md: 720px,
	  lg: 960px,
	  xl: 1140px
	);

ok so, now that we have everything redy we go for the 

ok so, I have to order the css elements considering they act for all the
elements it seems.

and the quantity of the background depends of the elements on it.

ok so , now we need to insert the script which allowed us to get only the first alue of a said 
object (in this case the blog entries and titles.)

anyway we set the name of the array as title.

the idea here is to have a loop which creates elements as long as there are entries in the
object.. so I should start from that.

ok so, I got a template for a footer now I need to see how some work and if I have to change some
with a css class.

anyway we had a ìn hr class that we were able to hide in a particolare weight of the screen with 

    d-md-none

and if you want to have list without stuff on them you can simpley.

    list-unstyled

some leftovers:

          <li>
            <p>
              <i class="fas fa-phone mr-3"></i> + 01 234 567 88</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <i class="fas fa-print mr-3"></i> + 01 234 567 89</p>
          </li>

ok so, considering we cannot change the native height of the footer
we are gonna put less content there so it s response as being smaller.

some more leftover:

<!-- Footer -->

<!-- Footer -->

ok so, we have 2 columns but one nested in another one with row.
but that can be a bit confusing, so,

to have and define the space between the borders just use the border.

ok so, we can load scss files just changing the style tag part.

    <style lang="scss">

    </style>

and the scss loader has to be installed.
with:

    npm install --save-dev node-sass sass-loader

ok so, here some text we are gonna work on.

ok so, lets talk about animating stuff here.
here we set the stats of the lightbox( kinda modal if we are talking of that):

  .portfolio-lightbox {
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: center;
    transform: scale(0,1); 
    transition: transform 2050ms ease-in-out;
    transform-origin: left; 
    padding: 2em;
    position: fixed;
    top: 0;
    left: 0;
    color: white;
    background: rgba(0, 0, 0, .5);
    // box-shadow: 0 0 0 100vmax rgba(0, 0, 0, .25);
    width: 100vw;
    height: 100vh;
    z-index: 10;
  }

transform-origin for example focuses on what happen AFTER the botto has been 
clicked....

anyway it seems that here we are referring to the element inside the modal 
inside all the page (which means that padding doesnt affect the content but the
squar the content is in)

and:

    position: fixed;

is what allow us to have the window with a scrollable background.
and it referres also the the darker space of background so if we moved it with

    top: 0;
    left: 0;

it also whould move.
and the background is indeed set by.

    background: rgba(0, 0, 0, .8);

which is just black with a different transparency.
and color: here is referred to the text withing.

ok so, you wanted to know where does the start of the transformation start from, 
and its on :target.

    .portfolio-lightbox:target {
      transform: scale(1,1);
      transform-origin: right; 
    }

ok so, this is how we can avoid using js with click on certain elements
(we use the lightbox as target for the event to happen).

ok so, the target pseudoclass works when we have a href that indicates something
n the html.

    <a href="#portfolio" class="close"></a> 

like here when it indicates the tag of teh other di on the html...
and so does the botton with.

    <a href="#portfolio-item-1" class="button" role="button">button</a>

in which the href targets the modal /lightbox its intent to open.

ok so, lets see the differences between 

    transform-origin: left; 

and the:

    .portfolio-lightbox:target {
      transform: scale(1,1);
      transform-origin: right; 
    }

ok so, the :target referres when the element is called by a heref (with
the tag we saw up there)

while the first which is put inside the lightbox tells us how to act when the 
elements itself goes under a transformation process (we didnt say how it was propted)

about the content:

    .portfolio-lightbox__content {
      width: 50%;
      padding: 1em;
      background: black;
      position: absolute;
    }

we set the position in absolute so to have a certain modal space for any
weight of the screen.

this seem useless.

    .portfolio__lightbox__image { margin-bottom: 1em; }

so the animation fo having it hover over was just aa speed up verson of the 
and here is how we define the cose botton.

    .close {
      position: absolute;
      right: -1em;
      top: -1em;
      border: white 2px solid;
      display: flex;
      width: 2em;
      height: 2em;
      background: red;
      border-radius: 50%;
      align-items: center;
      justify-content: center;
      text-decoration: none;
    }

    .close::after {
      content: 'x';
      color: white;
    }

in the first we set it and it seems it starts at the top right even if I dont know
how, ayway we set the content of it in the after.

(which is where all the stats of the content)

anyway we have to :

    .portfolio-lightbox{
      transform: scale(0,0.5); 
    }

ok so, except for the:

    transform-origin: top; 

which defines where the tranform will start from, we can influence how the x and y 
will act with scale(X,Y).

now, using a (0,0) will minimize the image and no visible while a (1,1)
is the native dimensions.

with:

    .portfolio-lightbox:target {
      transform: scale(1,0.5);
      transform-origin: left; 
    }

we define how the target works in this way.

    <a href="#portfolio-item-1" class="button rounded" role="button">button</a>

ok so, first we get a tag which "target" with a href property then.

    <div class="portfolio-lightbox" id="portfolio-item-1">
      <div class="portfolio-lightbox__content">
        <a href="#portfolio" class="close"></a> 

we set the elemet to open with the corrispective id, and here we have ANOTHER
href property, which we are gonna act later, anyway the react for the press of the first botton
is here.

    .portfolio-lightbox:target {
      transform: scale(1,0.5);
      transform-origin: left; 
    }

here the pseudo class target is referred to the href which activated after a click on the
first href, if we want to work on a transformation which happens on the element
that was opened:

    .portfolio-lightbox {
      display: flex;
      align-items: center;
      justify-content: center;
      transform: scale(0,1); 
      transition: transform 4050ms ease-in-out;
      transform-origin: top; 
    }

meanwhile this works if we have a botton on the class and it doesnt nterfere with
the tag its target.

in the first:

    transform: scale(1,0.5);

this.....is referred to the end state of the said element and 
it defines an element with the same X (1) and the Y haved.

anyway in case of closure, like in the second tranform.

anyway the idea here is to set up with wich dimensions it can start not end.
anyway we can target a specific element with :

    scaleX(0.7);

ok so, maybe we can choose to have a mechanism for the
gallery and another one for the modal...

ok so, lets study what we have beforehand, we start with a

    <fieldset class="slideshow">

    <label class="slide-button" for="slideCheckbox1">Intro</label>
    <input type="radio" id="slideCheckbox1" name="slide" v-model="picked">

    <div class="slide">
      <div class="slide__content">

        <h1>Slideshow Concept (No JS)</h1>
        <p>A pure CSS and HTML slideshow concept.</p>
        <p>To add or remove slides:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Add a new slide template in the HTML</li>
          <li>Update the <code>$slide-count</code> SCSS variable</li>
          <li>Tab colours: Update the <code>$c-slides</code> SCSS variable</li>
          <li>Slide popout images: Update the <code>$b-slides</code> SCSS variable</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Use the tabs below to change slide.</p>
        <p>Et voila.</p>
      </div>  
    </div>

while this defines the content of each slide, the first 2 tags referes to the system of
radio bottons we user to check if a certain element is clicked.
and the label is for having the botton to begin with.

    input {
      display: none;
      
      &:checked + .slide {
        transform: translateX(0px);
        transition: transform #{$animation-duration / 2} ease-in-out;
        
        .slide__content {
          width: 100%;
          display: block;
        }
      }
    }

ok so, after styling a bit the slideshow class.
we now target how the "botton" is supposed to work, first we dont display it

  display: none;

referred to the radio I guess, anyway:

    &:checked + .slide {
      transform: translateX(0px);
      transition: transform #{$animation-duration / 2} ease-in-out;
      
      .slide__content {
        width: 100%;
        display: block;
      }
    }

ok so the & sign in scss means 'this' and we are also targetting the 
.slide class after the checked class.

which gets the correspective snimation time and set the slide_content
with specific values.... I guess its coz its inside the said tag.

ok so, for our swipez and gallery setting we chose the:

ok so, considering we didnt seem capable of putting a string of values as the 

      <vue-picture-swipe class="move" 
        :options="{
          shareEl: false,
          index: 1
        }" 
        :items="items">
      </vue-picture-swipe>

directly to the tag, anyway we start setting

    index: integrer 

with this we can choose which element goes first (it can count the number of them
and it starts with 0)

    showAnimationDuration: 2000

this expresses in millisecond how much of image you have to wait untill being able to 
close or move it again.

    bgOpacity: 0.7,

ok so, this is to set the background to a minimun (from 0 to 1)

    maxSpreadZoom: 5

is to set the max zoom for touch I guess, anyway avoid big values for 
memory use.

    loop: true/false

I guess i allows you to pass trought images with a swift....

    closeOnVerticalDrag: true

this is for having the gallery closed if its tried to scroll up with o focus
(on pc always off, have to check with phone)

    escKey: true

its the one set by default and allow you to close if esc is used.
anyway if ya want to set how many images you want to pre-load.

    preload: [1,2]

the first for current images to load....the second for how many after...in 1.

ok so, I hvae to check if I can create only 1 array with this structure.

      <vue-picture-swipe class="move" 
        :options="{
          shareEl: false,
          index: 0,
          showAnimationDuration: 2000,
          bgOpacity: 0.7,
          maxSpreadZoom: 5,
          errorMsg: 'just the messsage if you need to',
          preload: [1,2],

        }" 
        :items="items">
      </vue-picture-swipe>

and the script.

    data() {
      return {
        items: [{
          src: 'http://via.placeholder.com/600x400',
          thumbnail: 'http://via.placeholder.com/64x64',
          w: 600,
          h: 400
        },
        {
          src: 'http://via.placeholder.com/1200x900',
          thumbnail: 'http://via.placeholder.com/64x64',
          w: 1200,
          h: 900
        }
      ]};
    }

I tried to create multiples I will use inline for now.

ok so, 3240830788 is the password for  wifi metropolitana...
I guess I could need that anyway.

anyway it seems that... there are some directives to use some custom scss file in only 1
but ATM not usefull.

anyway if we create a form we need to kepp the type of data which goes inside to be precise.
ok so, lets check te code down:


    <div>
      <b-form @submit="onSubmit" @reset="onReset" v-if="show">

this is where I guess we set the type of form we have... we could set this to just inline.


        <b-form-group
          id="input-group-1"
          label="Email address:"
          label-for="input-1"
          description="We'll never share your email with anyone else."
        >

ok so, getting to the first space, ok so we get the name with placeholder.
we also set a SPECIFIC type (email... I guess I wont work if it doesnt have @somthing)
requiered, we are left with the id (which I guess we will use)

v-model? 

          <b-form-input
            id="input-1"
            v-model="form.email"
            type="email"
            required
            placeholder="Enter email"
          ></b-form-input>
        </b-form-group>

ok so, here we have a scoll down option selector, even if there are ways to hard code them here 
we have them to referr into the data with / Food: and foods: /
we also can see used again the v-model here...
like for example an array for the elements 
:options="{ '1': 'One', '2': 'Two', '3': 'Three' }"

      <b-form-group id="input-group-3" label="Food:" label-for="input-3">
        <b-form-select
          id="input-3"
          v-model="form.food"
          :options="foods"
          required
        ></b-form-select>
      </b-form-group>

      <b-form-group id="input-group-4">
        <b-form-checkbox-group v-model="form.checked" id="checkboxes-4">
          <b-form-checkbox value="me">Check me out</b-form-checkbox>
          <b-form-checkbox value="that">Check that out</b-form-checkbox>
        </b-form-checkbox-group>
      </b-form-group>

      <b-button type="submit" variant="primary">Submit</b-button>
      <b-button type="reset" variant="danger">Reset</b-button>
    </b-form>
    <b-card class="mt-3" header="Form Data Result">
      <pre class="m-0">{{ form }}</pre>
    </b-card>
    </div>

ok so, lets see how it deals with the script...
if we want to analyze the data that is inserted in the form we have to use v-model.

here for example we have a validation from for a password.

    <template>
      <div>
        <b-form  @submit.stop.prevent>

ok so, this first label is just to put a title to the form.
("which we anyway got with the description property")

          <label for="feedback-user">User ID</label>

ok so in the script we are gonna use v-model=userId

          <b-input v-model="userId" :state="validation" id="feedback-user"></b-input>

          <b-form-invalid-feedback :state="validation">
            Your user ID must be 5-12 characters long.
          </b-form-invalid-feedback>
          <b-form-valid-feedback :state="validation">
            Looks Good.
          </b-form-valid-feedback>

we set the different text that has to happear below the text form, 
we still have to check how the :validation works, 

         </b-form>
      </div>
    </template>

    <script>
      export default {
        data() {
          return {
            userId: ''
          }
        },
        computed: {
          validation() {
            return this.userId.length > 4 && this.userId.length < 13
          }
        }
      }
    </script>

ok so, the v-model from before is what makes the data return, the part we extract and work with I guess.
and its the dara retured in the data()

meanwhile we set in compute (I guess we compute the data we put i the form)
we just set it to be more tha 4 charaters and less than 13.

and what If I wanted to create a list with datalist (so input text with potion and 
digits selection)

    <template>
      <label for="input-with-list">Input with datalist</label>

ok so, we start with the property list....which I guess defines the contect of the form spce..
ok so we differentiate between, input (which is just the text we put in)
and datalist (which sets the elements below), anyway there we set the data to be returned there.
as :options

      <b-form-input list="input-list" id="input-with-list"></b-form-input>
      <b-form-datalist id="input-list" :options="options"></b-form-datalist>
    </template>
    <script>
    export default {
      data() {
        return {
          options: ['Apple', 'Banana', 'Grape', 'Kiwi', 'Orange']
        }
      }
    }
    </script>

and in the script we have the array to be returned (there is also somekind of text detetntion for the 
words)

so, I can make use of arrays of data to set in listes AND, funtions which computethe input
and set it as acceptable or not.

ok so, we can just start with a 

    b-form 

ok so the basic structure for a form here is.

    <div>
      <b-form >

and here is where we can set the input and all the rest.
then we have events....I guess they have the @ to be called.
and Are cited in the script regarding the data in the form.

    <b-form @submit="onSubmit" @reset="onReset" v-if="show">

ok so, lets check how this one works.

      <b-form-group
        id="input-group-1"
        label="Email address:"
        label-for="input-1"
        description="We'll never share your email with anyone else."
      >
        <b-form-input
          id="input-1"
          v-model="form.email"
          type="email"
          required
          placeholder="Email here"
        ></b-form-input>
      </b-form-group>

ok so it seems that the b-form-group just gives the b-input
all sort of meta data (even if input-1 and input-group-1 arent the same)

ok so, we dont have to create a label tag to set the title but just a property.
label-for......targtes the b-form its into....

anyway I dont see a lot of changes by changing the label.for...

ok so, for the:

    <template>
      <div>
        <b-form-group
          id="fieldset-1"
          description="Let us know your name."
          label="Enter your name"
          label-for="input-1"
          :invalid-feedback="invalidFeedback"
          :valid-feedback="validFeedback"
          :state="state"
        >
          <b-form-input id="input-1" v-model="name" :state="state" trim></b-form-input>
        </b-form-group>
      </div>
    </template>

ok so, b-form-group helps us group the elements we want to give to our b-form-input which
is inside, label-for I guess its the tag that gets the elements.......
and the :referes to the script we method we use there.

    <script>
      export default {
        computed: {
          state() {
            return this.name.length >= 4 ? true : false
          },
          invalidFeedback() {
            if (this.name.length > 4) {
              return ''
            } else if (this.name.length > 0) {
              return 'Enter at least 4 characters'
            } else {
              return 'Please enter something'
            }
          },
          validFeedback() {
            return this.state === true ? 'Thank you' : ''
          }
        },
        data() {
          return {
            name: ''
          }
        }
      }
    </script>

for example we create computed methods which returns a undertext which different values.
and we first use the state computed method to set a boolean value 
depending on the number of digits which then we use on the computed.

and v-model name is returned which we use in the 

      return this.name.length >= 4 ? true : false

we could see up tehre how we used 2 label properties.
ok so , there seems to be some difference between a 
label tag and a legend tag... I guess label for is used to avoid
a pre rendered legend tag.

ok so it seems that the prop of laber-for can only be used if
we have only 1 element to target inside, (if you have multiple I guess
dont use it considering there is already a pre rendering.)

also it seems that the position of some elemets such as 

      label-cols-sm="4"
      label-cols-lg="2"

which allow us to put the title in a column setting.
doesnt go directly on the form-input.

ok so we can also get the title (label) bigger with:

    label-size="sm"

ok so, we will need to set the form nested structure plus see how to add stuff and dimensions
and work with the script.

ok so the :somthing you saw were css selectors used, like :valid inputs

ok so, we start settng the color of the form with :

    <b-card bg-variant="light">

(even If I should find a way to make it transparent...)

and it include all the elements on it (open close)

      <b-form-group
        label-cols-sm="3"
        label="Street:"
        label-align-sm="right"
        label-for="nested-street"
      >
        <b-form-input id="nested-street"></b-form-input>
      </b-form-group>

ok so, after the previous b-form-group this is the specific b-form-group
ok so, we get some props in the first tag of b-form.

    <div>
      <b-form @submit="onSubmit" @reset="onReset" v-if="show">

I will see if I find some of these in the script part.
and indeed they do, we first get the @submit.....
anyway it seems that the validation with the @submit is something we have with
the normal vue....

ok so, the submit is a submit handler. and like I said v-model connects the input to the output data.
I guess its linked to when its submitted... lets see the method.

    methods: {
      onSubmit(evt) {
        evt.preventDefault()
        alert(JSON.stringify(this.form))
      },

ok so..... form is a string which we create trought the data we have in the input.
ok so, we preventDefault...ok so, it seems that we prevent the default behavior of
submiting the for?....cancels the event if its cancellable....
"Clicking on a "Submit" button, prevent it from submitting a form"
ok so, idk if its coz we were just testing and we have to avoid or its actually how it works.
ok so, it can indeed stop an event (like clikig on a toggle (even If I have to check why))

anyway,we also have an alert......in which we set a JSON string of the form?
Convert a JavaScript object into a string with JSON.stringify().
and we have an alert with the data as a string.
anyway it can be done also for an array (does it matter?)

      onReset(evt) {
        evt.preventDefault()
        // Reset our form values
        this.form.email = ''
        this.form.name = ''
        this.form.food = null
        this.form.checked = []
        // Trick to reset/clear native browser form validation state
        this.show = false
        this.$nextTick(() => {
          this.show = true
        })
      },

ok so, we have onreset which is an event which we start using an handler @reset.
ok so, it seems that onreset is a specific event name.... in which we have to specify the
method... and it seems that the v-if="show" is used for a "trick" I guess its coz wee have a button for reset.
anyway here it says how we are gonna get an empty string for the email and name category and
the blank space for the food and empty options choosen (even if we have a prevent deault her ealso.)

        <b-form-group
          id="input-group-1"
          label="Email address:"
          label-for="input-1"
          description="We'll never share your email with anyone else."
        >
          <b-form-input
            id="input-1"
            v-model="form.email"
            type="email"
            required
            placeholder="Email here"
          ></b-form-input>
        </b-form-group>

ok so in the first form there isnt anything new. about the form.email.
I guess we use v-model to form an object in the return part of the 
script (in which we recolect data), 

      return {
        form: {
          email: '',
          name: '',
          food: null,
          checked: []
        },

and also the type allow use some typo filtrer.

        <b-form-group id="input-group-3" label="Food:" label-for="input-3">
          <b-form-select
            id="input-3"
            v-model="form.food"
            :options="foods"
            required
          ></b-form-select>
        </b-form-group>

ok so we here have a list selector which stull inlcuded a v-model for te food value(which we are gonna
include in theobject)

        foods: [{ text: 'Select One', value: null }, 'Carrots', 'Beans', 'Tomatoes', 'Corn'],
        show: true
      }
    },

the show I guess is there for the famous "trick", foods is an array in which the first value is 
defined by text and a value: null...

        <b-form-group id="input-group-4">
          <b-form-checkbox-group v-model="form.checked" id="checkboxes-4">
            <b-form-checkbox value="me">Check me out</b-form-checkbox>
            <b-form-checkbox value="that">Check that out</b-form-checkbox>
          </b-form-checkbox-group>
        </b-form-group>

and what about the checked?....

          checked: []

I still am not sure what the use for values here is, anyway

        <b-button type="submit" variant="primary">Submit</b-button>
        <b-button type="reset" variant="danger">Reset</b-button>

ok so, we also have specifi types of bottons (which helps us define their function)

      </b-form>

anyway we will see some props for the textarea of our form.

    size="sm"

inside the b-form-textarea , anyway in case the textarea would be shrink we
can disable that, with:

      no-auto-shrink

in the textarea tag.
and if you want you can set some readonly input 

    plaintext :value="text"

and then setting the text in the data with the text tag.
something about v-model modyfiers and .number .trim props.

ok so, we can indeed create an image with
  
    v-bind="mainProps"

on the tag b-img

    mainProps: { blank: true, blankColor: '#777', width: 75, height: 75, class: 'm1' }

and then in the script we have all the data about the image

anyway we found a way to show the image below the text and it dissapear for smaller screens I guess.
ok so, lets go fast forward and re sume how the modal clock came to be.

    <header class="showcase">
        <div class="container showcase-inner">
        <h1>Welcome</h1>
        <p>maiores sint impedit delectus quam molestiae explicabo cum facere ratione veritatis.</p>

        <div>
          <input type="checkbox" class="toggler">

              <input type="checkbox" id="html" value="HTML" class="toggler">
              <label for="html"><a class="btn">Read More</a></label>

          <div class="hamburger"><div>&#10007;</div></div>
        <div class="menu">
        <div>
            <div>
              <ul>
                  <li><a href="#">Home</a></li>
                  <li><a href="#">About</a></li>
                  <li><a href="#">Services</a></li>
                  <li><a href="#">Contact</a></li>
              </ul>
            </div>
        </div>
        </div>

        </div>
        </div>

and then this css code for the button etc..

    }
    .resto{
        margin-bottom: 30px;
    }

I remember getting a better version on it with the customable botton to hap and dis app.

anyway if you wanna align the text inside the label you better use the property:

    label-align-lg="right"

ok so, for now lets try to set the background to something transparent and then
use the image-query to show first one image then another.

anyway I just used a css selector to se the form...

after closing a lot of outdated pages I got to the point in which I need 
to do fancy markdown.

ok so, it seems that my markdown isnt working a lot, I have to find
where my current one is located and how to make it work.

ok so, the loader seems to transform a... I need to check what css selectors could
have weakened the md....anyway 

    text-align:

ok so, its time to try and see how this thing will work out...

at the moment we have our, 

vue.config-vue.js

  module.exports = {
    chainWebpack(config){
      config.module.rule('md')
        .test(/\.md/)
        .use('vue-loader')
        .loader('vue-loader')
        .end()
        .use('vue-markdown-loader')
        .loader('vue-markdown-loader/lib/markdown-compiler')
        .options({
          raw: true
        })
    }
  }

ok so, we start with downloading the

    npm i -D @void/vue-markdown-loader

and then we go modifying the vue.config.js

ok so, after dealing with some deals with the template we start cheking how to style the
md considering our limits.

ok so, we can add data inside the ( of the link of the image) like the tag #classista

    ![Philadelphia's Magic Gardens. This place was so cool!](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/8b/3e/e3/8b3ee330790c8aa2dc8c27615dcec773.jpg#classista)

using it in css (which will be in the vue component in which this is rendered)
like this.

    img[src*="#classista"] {
       width:150px;
       height:100px;
    }

ok so the one up there works coz we included the said src into the link but there are other ways.

    ![thumba](https://www.gamberorosso.it/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/tortellini.jpg#classista)
    img[alt="thumba"] {
     border: 5px solid black;
    }

ok so, here we base ourself in the alt that is included in the 

    ![thumba](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/001/247/268/8e7.jpg "nope")
    img[title=nope] {
        border: 10px solid red;
    }

ok so, here we keep the alt but we add a title under the " ", which we can then call with the
title=something. (I guess its different from the alt considering we already used the "")

ok so, we already know we can use some html tags in the markdown considering is still
html, so to use css classes we just.

    <div class="vedemo"> tis is the indeed thext</div>

and we refernce that with: 

    div[class=vedemo]{
      color: red;
    }

ok so, I guess the idea is to pre made some template effects we would like to use.
and mix them with the instruments that markdown already goves me(or at leas the ones that work for me)

ok, it seems that we can create made up tags in which put our tempate effect (also I should search
for some more specific html tags in this case.)

and the basic for the *bold* and the _corsive_

anyway the block of code with a specific language doesnt work.

with the mark just the background color and color for the text.
ok so, starting with the first effect, checking if we can use for some knd of md modyfy
using the css (probably not I will see)

we can use the flip effect for the content to try to list it....

ok so, about properties:

      box-sizing: border-box;

it allow us to just set both bordr and padding in the same pro.
(if width set to 300 and pad to 50 we wont have 350 total but
just 300)

anyway about how to get alements aligned, remember that using a div tag will always 
make them skip a line.

ok so, another tip, if you want, to set up element in a spcific display (like block or inline)
avoid using span to set an inline display against a block, instead just give it the property:

      display: inline-block;

inside the div tag.

anyway I still have to work with all the possible fonts.
this is a nice structure in case you wanted to set a tag and the correspondant child selector:

    h2 {
      margin-top: 3em;
      color: grey;
      &:first-child {
        margin-top: 0;
      }
    }

ok so, it seems that the a tag is used to set the edit into the text.
and we still dont knwo why the scss properties dont work without a h2 tag before it.

ok so, the plan is simple, setting image teplates for title and paragraph with the float which 
will help us not to break with the text.

anyway we start with the background color.
ok so, if you wanna break the line without having to put a empty line to space them just remember to give it a tab...

    here some text(tab)
    the html will give it a line break

ok maybe for the images I will need a media query considering they have to bee kinda big/small/a third considering the
device.

ok so, now we have to go for the title.
ok so, we also have a way to embed the elements inside a float 

    <div class="clearfix">
    <img class="img2" src="pineapple.jpg" alt="Pineapple" width="170" height="170">
    Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Phasellus imperdiet, nulla et dictum interdum...
    </div>

ok so, about the undeline effects we have to avoid it being too long....
ok so, we will set the media query on the same page without css external.
We will deal with Fonts later.

    background: linear-gradient(to bottom bottom,#a72222  0%, #c94b48 25%,#ff8a8a 50%, #c94b48 75%, #a72222 100%), url("../assets/case.jpg");

ok so, we still have to find where the background is set.
which is defined in the url.

ok so, setting a background color indeed makes it work like I think it does, but it seems that
the linear gradient is not universal in my site...

ok so if you wanna create some values to re use in the css just remember to do.

    :root {
      --overlay-color: rgba(24, 39, 51 , 0.85);
      --menu-speed: 0.75s;
    }

ok so lets re pass about the how s to add pre made text from the script.
ok so, first we have our data with a specific name in the data / return (which means it actually
returns and can be used in the file),
then to ue it we simply.

    {{texto}} 

    export default {
      name: 'pagina',
      data () {
        return {
          texto: 'welcome to the BloGk',
          image: require('../assets/case.jpg'),
        }
      },
    }

ok so, in case you use scss remmeber that the code works from all the
pages from 1 file (I guess it wont If I scoped) (it seems it doesnt affect...)

ok so, again the a tag just helps us to get into the text weight.
ok so, in soe instances of the final we are getting an effect not working unless is out of the square.

ok so, to have the check why the background works with home but not with container or even asteriks
ok so, we are gonna use it as max background for all.

ok so, I have to check how does the b-img work and how can I set an image
AND give it some properties.

ok It seems I will have to use images from idk my media (b-img only takes absolute values)
ok so, we add fluid as a prop in the b-img which makes it responsive AND also this:

    max-width: 100%; height: auto

I guess its referred to the parent tag and the height is more flexible.
ok, we need also to understand what is the use of:

    blank: true

anywya after thesting the new component or the other way in which we have to create a new page but w have 
a dedicated paragraph section...

ok, it seems that an inline-grid is just a smaller grid.

    grid-gap: 150px 20px;

and it covers the grid-row-gap first and the columns after.
we also have a measures which works with fr (which means for short proportional)

margin: auto is used to set an element to the center both 

ok so, lets check how we setled, again, the loop for the mages and text.

      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-4" v-for="(data,index) in gallery" :key="index">
            <img :src="data.image" class="img-fluid" style="width:100%"> 
            <h3 v-on:click="goTodetail(data.galleryId)" class="tres">{{ data.prompt }} sample</h3>
        </div>
      </div>

we get 2 atributes inside the v-for, we also name the font of the data (array or object)
in 'gallery' and we set the key for order.
then we just the their src to the data inside... and we do the ame for the text below.
also the v-on click works for a method which sent it to aother page.

and in the script we get the data:

       gallery: [
            {
            prompt: 'lets try the movement',
            image: require('../assets/case.jpg'),
            galleryId:1
            },
            {
            prompt: 'lets try the movement',
            image: require('../assets/909.png'),
            galleryId:2
            },
        ],

ok so, here we have a custom template which we setled in the main.js file
of our project.

      <template>
        <vue-picture-swipe :items="items"></vue-picture-swipe>
      </template>

anyway here we can see how to actuallt import a json array from another file.
    
    import Photos from '../statics/photos.json'
    items: Photos.content

here just an example ogf how it worked (just set the content name for the array with arrays)

              },
              {
                "id": 2,

                "title": "Will be used for caption"
              }
        ]
    }

    import VuePictureSwipe from 'vue-picture-swipe';
    Vue.component('vue-picture-swipe', VuePictureSwipe);

we register a specific new tag which we use in the vue files (considerng we routed it right)
we also had the explicit more:

    <div class="col-md-8">
    <vue-picture-swipe class="move" 
      :options="{
        shareEl: false,
          index: 0,
          showAnimationDuration: 2000,
          bgOpacity: 0.7,
          maxSpreadZoom: 5,
          errorMsg: 'just the messsage if you need to',
          preload: [1,2]
      }" 
      :items="[
        {
          src:  require('../assets/b7c.gif'),
          thumbnail:  require('../assets/b7c.gif'),
          w: 600,
          h: 400, 
          title: 'Will be used for caption'
        },
        {src: require('../assets/snow.jpg'),thumbnail: require('../assets/snow.jpg'),w: 200,h: 70 }
      ]"></vue-picture-swipe></div>

ok so, we still have to manage the columns.
ok so, if we talk about the colum template we can.

    grid-template-columns: repeat(10, 100px);

here we set a template which will repeat a structure for multiple elements AND
is about 10 each of 100px.
to have as many as they fill just:

    grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, 100px);

ok, anyway we got some stuff we dont need for the markdown.

    \* I am not sure what this is (escaping characters they said)
    \{ok maybe I get it}
    \+ remember when you studied decriptography?
    \! to avoid some typos to get translated by markdown.

we just jump over some typos that affects on the text.
we also dont have underline !underline!

considering we will use html we also sould give up stuff that worked for us.

    ok so this is barrato ~~barrato~~ and we get the simple underline __Sottolineato__

ok so, you can get some element as a list with distance.
    
    + Or pluses
    - and this?
    * and what about

we should find a way to get the code to show like it does with.
also blocknotes doesnt work.

    > Blocknotes doesnt work

I guess you can use this in case you dont want to use the double comma.

    <q> what would we use this for? </q>

ok so, we start our animation with.

    @keyframes fadeIn{ }

ok so, what we use is the vue toold for animations.

    <transition name="anim">

wrapper component:

    .Feeling-enter-active{
      opacity: 0;
      transition: fadeIn 1s ease-in;
    }

ok so, about this prop, aplied during enterig phase, uses for 
which I guess is different from:

    .Feeling-enter, .fade-leave-to {
      opacity: 0;
    }

which is the state of the transiftion before it starts and remuved after inserrted...
ok so the Feeling enter up there is the state it enters before the transition
from which it has to recover in the times and ways its defined in the.

    .Feeling-enter-active, .fade-leave-active {
      transition: opacity 5s;
    }

which defined what we have to wear us off and how much time does it need for that
so the idea would be to have a 

-enter -> -enter-active -> leave -> leave to

in which the ending and starting opacity are the same and the process is defined
together in the opacity.

ok so , in our animation we need both the:

    .Feeling-enter-active {
      transition: all 2s ease;
    }
    .Feeling-leave-active {
      transition: all 2s cubic-bezier(1.0, 0.5, 0.8, 1.0);
    }

one refers when the the state will move to the next while the leave-actuve, when the
old state will leave the current (you get the new content but on the old
background, so its better to keep them equal in time.)

so, what about the animation css property.

    .Feeling-enter-active {
      animation: bounce-in .5s;
    }
    .Feeling-leave-active {
      animation: bounce-in .5s reverse;
    }
    @keyframes bounce-in {
      0% {
        transform: scale(0);
      }
      50% {
        transform: scale(1.5);
      }
      100% {
        transform: scale(1);
      }
    }

ok so, we use the property and it seems we dont need the 

    .Feeling-leave-active{
      animation: moveInUp 1s ease-in;
    }
    @keyframes moveInUp{
     0%{
      transform: translateY(0);
     }
     50%{
       transform: translateY(-250px);
     }
      100%{
      transform: translateY(-400px);
     }
    }

ok so, keeping this here just to avoid losing it somewhere else.

ok so lets try to be clear about how to upload a folder as a new repository.
in case after doing the:

    git init
    git add .
    etc etc but also

  in case you get the

  fatal: remote origin already exists.
  you can reset the remote origin.

    git remote rm origin

and then you can ope it again.

5:09:19 PM:   Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '/opt/build/repo/public/index.h  tml'

ok so, to get ahead of the problem I just had to resolve the ENOENT error
(which meant to simply npm install (i didnt know I didnt had it))

ok so, what about the colors for the logo:
ok so, exept the classic C80815 and the deb887

so, what about changing the color selecting the color.

anyway about the brushes we used in the logo.

-bristles-1-details. nose 
-(light trait face) ink-2-fineliner.
- hard border (basic 1)
-bandana lines (bristles-2-flat-rought)
-and also for the glasses (bristles-2-flat-rought)
-for the hair (pencil-3-large-4B)

-ok so foe the background: (watercolor-texture)
-texture-impressionist (background)

ok so, idk if I said it before but here we use the push to come back to
one step.

    <button type="button" class="btn btn-primary" v-on:click="navigate()"> 
        minus 1
    </button>

      navigate() {
          this.$router.go(-1);
      },

anyway the second goes for the script.

considering the lenght of the content hosted here it s not optimall
to keep a catalog of the daily develpment of the various argumenst
its about complete thoughts for each rticle.
for a more daily content or progress on each argument you
can follow the seguent links.

All the articles here posted are the conclusion of a process of development
on the various arguments/branch/ to keep more in touch with me
on a daily basis you can check my socials here showed.


the idea could be to have other blogs..?
I mean I could fartfecth a line for the title of the deviantart
or maybe If I have an account somehwere....
maybe 1 for the github as a warehouse of code.
I mean I can give them an icon and stuff, still not full 

anyway we kinda resolved the form for vue, we installe dthe.

    npm install -g @vue/cli

(it seems we didnt had it before)
also installing mdb-vue for the form.

    import 'bootstrap-css-only/css/bootstrap.min.css'
    import 'mdbvue/lib/css/mdb.min.css'
    import '@fortawesome/fontawesome-free/css/all.min.css

anyway with this plugin we could had installed both the bootstrap and the fonts...
we already have those so we ust import the mdb.

ld notes.
anyway the differences between the 2 is that we dont have a 
method="post" in the index.html.

ok so, lets try to set this up in a way.
ok it seems we dont need a specific tag for the submit bottom in the index html...

    <form name="ask-question" netlify netlify-honeypot="bot-field" hidden>
      <input type="text" name="name" />
      <input type="radio" name="panelist" />
      <input type="email" name="mail" />
      <textarea name="question"></textarea>
    </form>

this is an example in which we simply set the inputs we have a name.
and also the type of input/textarea with the class name to get the correspondent
in the vue file.

    <form
      name="ask-question"
      method="post"
      data-netlify="true"
      data-netlify-honeypot="bot-field"
      >

ok so, we get the method and the same name as in the html and the method.
in the form that contains it all.

      <input type="hidden" name="form-name" value="ask-question" />

I still dont know if this hidden is needed.

      <label v-for="(panelist, index) in panelists" :key="index">
        <input
          type="radio"
          name="panelist"
          :value="panelist"
          @input="ev => form.askPerson = ev.target.value"
          :checked="form.askPerson === panelist"
        />
        <span>{{ panelist }}</span>
      </label>

here for example we have just a loop for 2 bottons.
even IF i would like to use a different structure.

      <p>
        <label>First Name</label>
        <input name="name" type="text">
      </p>
      <p>
        <label> email? </label>
        <input name="mail" type="email">
      </p>
      <p>
        <label>Question</label>
        <textarea name="question"> 
        </textarea>
      </p>

and it seem that the submit botton just needs to be so.

      <button>Submit</button>
    </form>

ok so, what we deleted? in the html.

    <form name="contact" method="POST" netlify-honeypot="bot-field" data-netlify="true" hidden>
        <p class="hidden"> 
          this isnt supposed to be filled I guess
        </p>

for example here just we have the method expresses, and a added hidden
message.

        <p>
          <label>Your Name: <input type="text" name="name" /></label>
        </p>
        <p>
            <label>Your Email: <input type="text" name="email" /></label>
          </p>
        <p>
          <label>Your subject: <input type="text" name="subject" /></label>
        </p>
        <p>
          <label>Message: <textarea name="message"></textarea></label>
        </p>
        <p>
          <button type="submit">Send</button>
        </p>
      </form>

anyway we also have a tag for the submit and all the input for the data (the label is 
not needed)
-about the form itself we just have v-model="form.subject" which we use on.
anyway we also have a specified empty array from the form.

      return {
        form: {
          askPerson: "",
        },

which we used I guess to get an empty value without a pre made value

        panelists: ['Evan You', 'Chris Fritz'],

        currentPanelist: 'Evan You',
anyway we dont use this value even in the method after.

and also we get rid of all the method.

      encode(data) {
        return Object.key(data)
        .map(
          key => `${encodeURIComponent(key)}=${encodeURIComponent(data[key])}`
        )
        .join("&")
      },
      handleSubmit () {
        fetch('/', {
          method: 'post',
          headers: {
            'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'
          },
          body: this.encode({
            'form-name': 'contact',
            ...this.form
          })
        })
        .then(() => console.log('success I guess'))
        .catch(e => console.error(e))
      },

I hope I dont have to install axos like the page says.
so, what do we need to?

    <p>
      <label>First Name</label>
      <input name="name" type="text">
    </p>
    <p>
      <label> email? </label>
      <input name="mail" type="email">
    </p>
    <p>
      <label>Question</label>
      <textarea name="question"> 
      </textarea>
    </p>
    <button>Submit</button>

anyway we just added the names of the input on the html.
I still have to find a way for the list of items.

      onSubmit(evt) {
       evt.preventDefault()
        alert(JSON.stringify(this.form))
      },

anyway to avoid to have the array from the data we remuved this method.

ok so, considering we simply get the type of input and then it should be fair game.
but we would need to knwo what type of data we have on that input.
