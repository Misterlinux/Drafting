some law here:
with prescrizione we define a set of time after the trial desist.
normally it tends to be as long as the max condamn plus 1/4, except when
Ergastoo (like with murder)
during Berlusconi it got shorter for some crimes.
Now with the with the 5s the prescrizione is stopped after the first grade.
exist from the Roman law for convinience, it is said to limit the lenght giving a pre-made
fair-lenght but thats not the correct proceduere.
Normally it stops after any giudicial act, and also 
incentive lawyers to stall in cases of corruption.
In other cases the lenght of the trial can be considered as passes condamned time.
(in italy can sometmes changed for money)
some judges start after the prescrizione or start late the indagine.
Also in Ita there arent penalties in going to the other grades.
and half of people in jail are waiting the first audience.
