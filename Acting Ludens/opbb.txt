ok so, about the fighting blood.

bottons for damage to combo/
unique to strong or effect/
jump to quick evade, mix starter and movement option/ 
guard vs most - movement /
dash to break combo rythim countareble/
guardbreak vs continous guard to free Y (long option vs dash)

no combo from Y starter but can sometimes be mix with X

Support as stats or passive but not shown in battle

Manage:
Ability on logia or haki, logia to instant evade combos
visible, grabable and guardbreak and instant loss if vs haki
chargeable if no attack and if 0 wait to complete
usable also for special movements.
Gauge, from giving/receiving used by half up to swap 
actions/counters, awaken: +atk,def timed or final move.

camera with option of distance and not plain 2D
just different on left/right, linked to front
movement free but still linked (camera not character)
with:
-y attacks with hitbox and distance (mostrly straight, some)
-dash + X to connect on knokt with hitbox
-special + jump different effects 

-----------------------------------------------

defined melee style fight (melle for the movement or combo play)
like grand battle series/ spike chunsoft's style, team with cap max point based on characters? 
(not important I guess)

free-sandboxed-3D movement with basic attack strings allocated to a single button, 
along with specific button combinations, which can allow access to special moves

ranged option with back X, Y or break.

hitbox just as front and position.

options to vreak down combos:

	-knokt down and invin. frames that can be timed 
	-long distanced launch and knokt
	-inconsistent flash-guard flash-counter or offsets
	-swap, consuming the gauge for half
	-logia, limited for some, punisheable consuming L and hakai attaks can go beyond
	-limited counters, elusive or invin. atk that some

in case of long distances or aproach, how to cover:

	-walking, vulnerable but controlable and optionable
	-L and jump, consumes L variable but dodge, guardable and punishable some
	-dash + atk (also normal attacks tend to aim to the adv) cover more and heavy hitbox
	-some attacks Y cover larg distance or specific special moves
	-walk + jump attack to elude front attacks (area, time and result, like knokt vary on x,y)

interaction:
	3X attacks + break vs guard
				 finish X vs normal
				 special x/y/guard for damage or mix
				 ranged or some special vs roll
				 ranged break for longers rolls
				 Y for some
