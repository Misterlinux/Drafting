about the soni anc the ransformation.

the first world that would come in mind if comparing (yes we need a plan to undestanding)
this game to mario kart it would be: rought
not talking of course of command and stuff, thore are almost the same but of how much
"fracasone" it is in confront of the latter, movement is expanded, or more like, less controlled
space tends to be larger both considering the extra states for which the 
cars transform , but lets focus on the car part
acrobacies tend to be faster and play more on the movement (there is not fixed animation)
and on timing and their multiply and stackable adds playa factor
they also have movement and give the option to drift while mid-hair
if you prefer to prepare to a curve instead of stack and the movement 
helpt to control not ot go out of route 
another elemnt we can see is in short interaction or more like instant attention
and its about items, ice come in pack of 3 and are hitscan
and fast at trowing fast sequence, 
normal boost, wispes, it would be more like an attack to the front with dodgeable 
penalizes the first while helping the ones behind
(some obstacles can get hit trought to avoid, not too sure on the wisps tho)
target bomb, which hit the next car, its kinda slow and can indeed be out runned by the 
target considering it knows its coming
pufferfish which can be used both verses and can act as a banana but
its bigger and much faster to trow ahead and bigger so more aimable
all star for the specified super form, it gets faster but still vulnerable 
with variations on what it can do (damage area near or trow projectiles or
simply protecting its influenced in the char stat)
and my favorite the rotog, in which you get faster but with levels that can 
overheat you and with area damage at the end in bases of how much vs others
here you get playa factor both in movement and damage

what about the roads, circuits themself, it can be see that there is more space
even tho with high speed some obstaclese tend no to be seen while other work 
in a fast objective setting (like timing the robot to get the boost/item)

what is lacking is the jump, space is used in drift or performances while in 
kart you get to micro step your run for a moment, fast reaction and management 
or even recover considering most moves hitscan, but not from close considering 
only rodhog has area close damage while staying behind dangerous.

so tranformations? tranformation:
