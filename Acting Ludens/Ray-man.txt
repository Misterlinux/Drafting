about the Ray-man of light.

so, the first thing to impress me on at the opening of the game manu was the music, perfect.
a platforment but with the idea of an adventure trought places of legends and magic.
and also that I set the volume too high.

so, lets start with rayman itself, rayman is the demonstration how to improve volume trought
acrion and movement, again what does this mean? 2D platform but not just 
jump, walljump, Float, heavy fall, attack, charged atk.
this allow margin of manouver for jumps and allow
more possible interaction against obstacles, 

probably the less impactufull but more fun, or at least different from the jump or movement 
it never focalized in anything similar to combat, its more like to remuve obstacles under the form
of enemies, this is reflected to the simple health bar, 1 hit or 2 if finding some specific or after minichallenges
but having automatic game over on pits or bigger enemies.

is rayman fast or slow? you will end up running and the difficuty is ofter found in repetitions of particular
pats of the stage in which you are supposed to react fast, but most of the levels rely in
repetition and exploration, which tend to be vertical, cheking roof or trying to
get acces in areas keeping itself safe troght slow and carefull movement, thats the reason the coing 
checks if you get it after being it, it being vertical reflects the role of 
walljump and glide ability, to be able to controll one position in the air.
but this slowers the game.
But then you get music levels in which keeping the streek of movement (lol) with the music is the only point
with also the time bomb extra missions and the pre-lude to the final boss of each world.
the minimission you find in the world to free the extra things are close-up spaces in which
specific movement, not fast one, is required.

anyway more to say?
