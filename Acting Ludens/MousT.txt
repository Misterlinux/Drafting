about the mosou.

movement, continous playing, territory management
speed, 

Musou isnt fighting games.

I will probably repeat this more times during the video but listen carefully

Musou isnt fighting games.

ok? ok dont worry explanation will be made, anyway  lets get the ez stuff over with
Musou isnt kinda of the techincal/official name for this genre
is more like the name used for the Samurai/Dynasty warrior saga of games made by koei Tecmo
(It seems that only they can or are willing to, well the know how has to be there considering the number and
different leves and mechanics developed AH this later)

ok so but what is a musou, a hack-and-slash action games with a focus on combat rather than strategy (ehhh)
it is considered used errouneous for 3D action games considering it originates from D&D
whatever got it?

ok so, 3D action game lets start, Combat is defined by the adversary/Opponent AND that
defines the envirdoment envirodment defined by dunamic of the game

what are our oponents here then? MASS , well masses, innocue by themselves
and still innocuos in number your interaction with them goes like this:
Hack and Slash areas of them, be fast and move tho, you dont wanna have your epic combo being interompted by
some spear bois
again, this isnt a problem in this genre (most of the times) coz you have :
1: large numbers of them so it makes sense you optimaze direction and specific moves or movements
options to rid most of them in less time possible, and the large number allow moves to actually continue
and developt as they were intend to be without risking to hitting the air OR with the option
to calibrate yourself during the move to cover areas not yet covered, again masses move with you
(in response) covering your flanks as to give you agency and give rythim to the fight
(the fact that they can beat you or leave your hp low by wrong positiong or sub optimizing
moves that leave you open for attacks is there too)
2: a bigger picture, objectives on a battlefiled that the player influences with all the hack and slashing
by just playing, again it had to be clear how the mechanic used to complete these objectives has to be
part of the mechanic, which is moving AND hacking, so destroying objectives or capturing bases or bosses
What not to do, gimmick (the bow in DW9 anything that doesnt encaja on the moving and slashing At the same timr)
or actually going against the gameplay (staying on a specific place or stealth without weps ??)

ok so, about options to do what you are already doing (moving and slashing) but better
for the slash just some combos with the position we said before and consumable moves (the musoue gauge is the standard)
but some add item for maintenace or effect (even if hyrule warriors has a problems with that, but thats for later), 
changing heroes, abilities to change stats the envirodment or to move the
allies or iteract with bases whatever standard, and for movement something that can be used to speed up
but that sacrificies something on the slash part (a consumable sprint , kinda of, a hourse that limits
your attack moves) or on the map design part to set links to the mosre important areas
OR EVEN shorcuts or passages at a cost(like abilities ans such) to avoid backtraccking
again a good musou isnt where you always advance.
a good musou is where you CHOOSE how to advance, you will advance anyway (you shoul also do that in 
a decent time and if you arent it s only for your bad decision on management)
managing YOU and the resoursesto reach the objective with options.

ok so lets talk a bit about the rest, you know the army its suppoed to advance with you, 
divided (hopefully) in mass and allies (the equivalent of bosses on the other side)
ok so, they cant be always near you by default, (so the option to call some for the last point , as a rush on time or
just to get it faster is indeed needed)
you need space/mass of enemies for yoursef for most of the 
game so most of times they will cover the rest of the battkefield
you know, the part of the map with the bjective you dont wanna cover or left in the back to
defend the bases to avoid getting cut off (coz backtracking manually is bad as is the game that doesnt offer options for it)

ok so other adversaries, minibosses, you already know this, more hp, can deal damage and what more?
well considering you are the spear that lets the rest of the army in (thats what conquering bases is
you enter clean and let them) the same for them would allow the creation of dynamics too, units that
have to be dealt with by you or your allies or stalled for some strtegies like being at their back or stuff
(if they would do that t you it would be 2 times better) and if you ignore them but are close to the objective on the 
final base they come in and screw over your attempted rush.
small inciso on the giganti boss, it being slow have to play a role in the map
so as a wall or a tickling clock that messes up your strategy

for the bigger picture, batlefield mchanic the key word is m o v e m e n t
you have to be playing, calculating your next move after hearing some dialogue by your allies or enemies
(not just empty compliments for slashing, thanks I saw that)  and seeing the the configuration of forces
you check if your bets before the battle hold on.

so we checked what we do, what we do after the slash, what do others, what should do the ones against you.

well now for the bigger bigger picture, we talked about the missions but what after well....
if the game is licensed or is based from a pre-existed story its more probable to have story bits
as cutscenes and mission with some story in.
cheking the koei tecmo are ambiented in the 3 kindom era for china in the dynasty seriie while
samurai is in japan before noburaga.
conquest of territories, how? well if the mission is completed you get an area and added up the unifing the
territories as endgame with some options on ow to manage or how to manage the political situation
on alleancies or moves or delegation to officers for smaller roles on objectives, again similar to the 
mission, m o v e m e n t  of resourses troops and alliances (imagine it being an open world, what can possibly go wrong)

so some brushes on the tried games:
Warriors Orochi 4: slow, no sprint , too many muso moves changeable heroes tho, slow, no jump

pirate warrior 4: NICE STUFF, long spring ez to unlock combos, allies on the field and 
some nicely inserted secodary missions, variety of styles (even if tecnic still slow and tashigi isnt viable ;(
giant enemy bosses but movement with nice jumps but too many 1 vs 1 ;/ some maps kinda cofused but nice music (like most)
and some secondaty missions and variety (like escorting and objectives) not a lot of territory management tho
4 customable moves tho

pirate warrior 3: I was kinda curios on this one, not too sure on the comic like presentation.
allies with custom moves and pair-up in some combos with custom names and quick time event
lower spring and some creativity on the island mode custom adventure kinda of

dynasty warrior 8 empires: kinda of the golden stan



dynasty warrior 9: so, the fall from grace is said, (well its not worse than the orochi 4 but)
the open word, not needed, if missions are on city or towns you will have to reach them 
the most that happens are group of revels (that can be travote by horse) or mini missions and SMALL missions on villages
press on map, hourse + auto run + sprig, wow, the hourse who didnt allow you to play on it totally 
in the 8 here is un stoppable, random added bow (slow and useless considering you can climb towers)
oh, towers to get info on area..... what can exist, this is a musou not breath of the wild
what can you find, small villages or sones to musou on? I mean can you do that on a cave or forest?
no, you need a map design bases objectives not random dozen of weak opponents to quick time event into
oh quick time event , indeed there were problems on what to do with the Y heavy hit instead of rapid firing X
but......having scripted close up to the mass cuts interactivity in a genry in which is kinda limited
anyway trigger+move like in one piece interesting effect, 
open world for ingredients (scrools to craft items) if only I could craft outside a city and a shopkeeper
again why open world
so you get to the mission, well remember to check for the level, indeed considering that moving around this empty
and boring map you better check you can win, now on the map design
considering that the number of cities had increased their design is simpler, well yes, you wont lost 
of course but.....
also about zones and long 

some points vs: 
-"For the first time in the series, the expansive land of China is shown on a single map with the introduction of an open world format for diverse progression through the game"
ok so, yes, first time indeed, who knows why there werent attempts of this before 
also in that "diverse progression" indeed  on map + hourse +  auto-run + spring is fun
(the house isnt even stopped)
"The ‘one vs. thousands’" indeed kind of difficult to reproduce if you ae on some mini mission
along the way on a willage, and on cities? well...
-"exhilarating action of the Warriors series and the beloved characters from the Romance of the Three Kingdoms tale are carried over, but the freedom through an open world stage provides a brand new Warriors experience."
well not so much if some many quick time events or even scripted moves, there arent a lot so its minor 
(even if the Y on top is kinda annoying) ok so, I will talk about the writing more ahead of this
can someone tell me what kind of "freedom" do you get, you need cities or structures to ambient an army
battle, you cant do that on the woods, thats why map design is for, maybe the freedom to choose
your mission or movemet but again   on map + hourse +  auto-run + spring is fun
-"Key Missions unfold and progress the story of the player character, and are supplemented by numerous missions from various regions such as Regular Missions that affect the Key Missions and requests from other characters"
now, how this game uses its characters is inda interesting, and the progress done with one pass to the
other if changing midways, but again, why open world I mean each time you finish a mission you get more 
"territories" I guess the protagonist adds them as their own ?? helps the empire ??
now missions that influence others, idk that
now for the strategy based on position and alone attacks in night ... umh
-"The new State Combo System reacts and responds to the surrounding conditions" now, its responsive, or at least 
the Y happears on top of any enemy and as botton for quick time event midways combos so, no.
there are special + normal moves like pirate warrior linked to specific roles tho
flow attack that chage depending on enemy state while reactive that optimally adapts to situation
while trigger chages the state... ummm
-so, some positives, the effects on the uso attacks are cool, in 8 they were kinda random and not really clear
here some elements and close ups, nice, the jump is better, well the double jump, you get up from
being knoket down easily and the hook seems like a nice addiction, altrough the running is cumsy
verbose, long and clocied (it rushed in the green)
but the timelines is nice, history book

berserk: so, setting the gore, indeed some attention for that, dash for running kinda
and also reduce cool down some heavy moves (Y + A +Y) and dodge
range and multiple opponent from the very start as idea, 
souls..... ok, to fill gauge after stats gauge for final blow
you dont see a lot of "obliteration" just the cut effect
levels to unlock moves ... 
stats gauge for the range also, in the first mission you get ambushed with limited
space to process, nothing crazy if you had to keep safe the allies whould have been better
4 stats, items and equips and hourse with stats and limits to how much stravolge or fast

-the sword, indeed Guts seems to be abe to get some more tools
anyway range slow but position calibrate during hits or break with dash,
umm I guess I can go bac on me saying its not a fighting game
-grifith: indeed its moves make him move and its faster, altrought 
its harder to hit, ;/ anyway sable
-caska, martial arts with moves and ultimate with troops, nice

sub weps, wels flying knives to stun some groups, and cooldown, 


all stars: kinda too many furries, anyway guard, no, bad, it forces as a mechanic to stay still
with a lot of enemies on sceen, also has a jump botton easily liked with
heay for ground area or light for some area forward, 
I can say that even if the days is uneccesary tedious (its executable with jump in close situations)
but to be sure you have to press guard+jump, and considering its supposed to be a fast
and re-active option, No
I can say that you can see how this is a crossover as objective and mechaanics are influenced by it
example: you can get 4 in your team, used as:
assist I guess, with the directional arrow , I say I guess coz they move at the same turn, same attacks also
for more damage and range, limited and then cooldown, OR you can have them as special moves (assist)
with one L R and a bottom, more?
relationship are a mechanic and using memebers will add a level on that to get more "gift" at tne end of levels
and considering the space avaiable in the free area you get for idling dialogoe options as well
now the musou gauge, indeed  here also you have the options to bust but, 
yo get, a public, the more enemies you ko, its kinda cool also for the compliments you get
(yeah I guess I will tacckle a bit of how dialogues should work in games like this)
and it seems you get more enemies on the screen to not be idle and the duration is based also on ko.
and even if cool and campy I would pass on it, the presentation limits your camp of view and
limits the play to just masching botton (which was what you were doing before but without the larger view)
on the other sideits not otimal
altrought captured points give you items to charge faster the cooldown for the assist thats cool
allow you to use more the special options considering the combos you have are kinda limited and
not improved with the jump and also limted by the level requirememnt.
it centers too much on yu as a player and so map becomes just a corridor to complete objectives 
there are sub-missions but if there is only you it just become a diversion.
cards, as collectables to buy to power uop character with effects and abilities plus some crafting for
upgrade the I guess, 
It has a lot of extra sauce on it but the base isnt good enought to let it be.


(this doesnt excuse the quick time effect ... DW9 oooof)
