dynasty warrior 4 hype:

ok so, 3D mayps and a lot of fog for less enemies and bodyguards.
also small record of actions at the end.

3d is cool but most story is just linear objective for official.
unit in city sieges by units in doors but objective in official in top of it.

still 3d would be needed ig Y axis is used by movement option.

jumpt+light for directional hit
jump + heavy can be stoped by move 

the horse isnt included, you can steal or equip for later.
short storycuts and dub by 4kids, but better than dynasty 9

but magic, at least at first, winds to stop parhs from advancing, geysers from ground to block movement
rolling rocks thunders, magic copies from dark soul 2 that needs to have their bowls destroyed.

weps are limited a lot and only 3 kindoms and the heavy is the special action, sometimes not linked
to the wep, also arrows.... which could work with our bodyguards wich we cant guide too much.

also the lack of the 2 a camer hurts a lot and the possibility of changing action middle.
some tecs for getting up and mosou is smaller but easier to use, too much area clean gimmmich
