ok so, the 5 days playing straight civilitation 6:

so, at first I thougt the objective was to conquer the world, and didnt get too well the idea of
influences and continued to lsoe cities after taking them.
thats kinga good coz it forces you to work trought positiona nd conseguence also
on the near cities, but it doesnt get much more like pacts to not interfere in the city
or even enought turns to set spies and work around it, anyway I went for the trade and gold route
(it doesnt seem to be a win condition for that)
cheking production on the map or checking the inahibitants contions, but If I would express how iT felt
I would say like the kinda of Mobile games but without the time waiting, so thats why it can feel kinda addictive at fisrt
but if we talk about movement except in war, the few buildings you get for area (which you need workers for) and explorers (missionaries) there isnt a lot of it, I mean resources matter and trade allow you to get rid of what you stack
with tecnological advance being the timing for when to do so.

resources vary on what you research and I got hit by that, also I should ahve worked more spyes and amenities
to try to get cities with less inimicizia from others for moving troups, anyway the fact that at the end it seems
that everyone will hate you or from you moving your troops close, or just for paying against
other they like, 

every resource is usefull, money to expand, buy units or even buildings
science to get the objectives and culture to do the same, and both can allow the victory
faith can buy some units that can be used for religion spread and healing and also
rock bands or naturalist, thats kinda weird, anyway for the influence and envirodment.

the use of diplomatic point is interesting, the idea of receiving defouff for one own action is something
I saw in the latest part of my pay when accused of warmorgering (which I was, but I had to do that
before the uranium finished) but if you got more than 5 votes you will almost everytime win
even if others go against you, anyway it can allow you for some discounts on units
or criple other players, 

conseguences, this is what this dude said about it and I guess it is, 
your form of goverment infleuences which parts of the production you want to favor
and choosing between the tecnological advances allow you to discover building or resources
troops have a maintenance cost and in the future it can cost even strategic resources
(even If some units seemed inda useless to me, like the ant air and the drone)
but its nice that you can upgrade and promote units with experiece,
