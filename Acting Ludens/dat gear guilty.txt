the guilt gear:

ok so, I use to not like 2 d fighting games , I mean smash bros is an exception coz it prioritazied 
movement and I dont have to try any halfmoon, and most of the problem are that
movement options tend to be limited and moves require too much setup also thelimited space 
doesnt give enought space for those manouvers, which favours combos limited (again problems that you dont find in smash)

and yes, even If I had fun with guilty gear I saw these problems, and I am not too much sure
if range is balanced, as Faust the ranged option are slow and the projectile is arc based and kinda un reliable
anyway what I liked.

-you can shiled while in air, nice incentives, 
-the designes , no not grafics, you already know that I talk about the use
of items and weps and stuff, most are blade like but still, the sheer volume of what is shown
and withoout filling the screen, again Faust, 
-I would say the 4 bottons of light, medium, heavy and Slash, In faust case its range, well
-some designes are kinda good, again we get more gigity ninja that really doesnt express.
