ultimate budokai

so, how does the 3d budokai top works?
4 botton for options on:

-Y ranged attack
-X shield and tele
-A attack 
-B movement, dodge or grab

-R and L to up and down (complete 3D)

-Z power up Ki

Z + B for power close or 2X for back (vs guard) consumes Ki 
to cover up distancing attacks.

different stances when lock on... differences in B and some special moves that need to back off some.

lateral B in close but doesnt grant same invincibility as B

max power allows ultimate moves (finish it and limited time)

special Y as long option (beans and stuff) dodgeable with x and timing or partially shield or even dodge

special X for utility most, like shields/instat dodge etc consuming both stats
(levels that rechard automatically)

while control stick used to change teamate or tranform.
