all .vue fies are mounted in the components file.
and using for the bacground the app.vue and the app.css.
which is the real single page. kinda

we render everything with the <vue-router> tag.
still dont know how that exactly work 

about the file management, we can resume all of the data
	yarn run build
we create a file for production...
there is also the 
	yarn serve
all in the dist file.
