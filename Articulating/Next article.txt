okso, what is this blogk.

we use a Json file for al the metadata about each article.
inside the src -> statics (it seems they have to be there)

how does the component work?

{
    "Introduction": [
        {
            "id": "5571",
            "date": "30 agosto, 2019",
            "title": "5571 lines and a Blogk",
            "description": "About the language and the story of this Blogk",
            "src": "//live.staticflickr.com/65535/49193979161_783de3db6a_z.jpg"
        },
        {

        }
    ],

ok so, each article has metadata that can and will be used to opder the articles (idl if its for
the API function. used where?)

where is the .md files?

order is still important and we get the markdown files in the same folder.
markdown -> arguments -> .md article
[each one is present in the Json file now for the name but for the position.]

role of the main.js which is different from the vue.config
in which we import and external framework and specific conponent
(plus the order to mount all togheter)
we set up the import and the use for those plus the 
use of specific components, plus the specific vue and router.

import Vue from 'vue'
import App from './App.vue'
import VueRouter from 'vue-router'
import VuePageTransition from 'vue-page-transition'
import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css'

import routes from './routes';

Vue.use(VuePageTransition)
Vue.component('vue-headful', vueHeadful);

and in the router.js,
in which we import the pages to be mouted in app plus the specific routes
that are accesible 

import pagina from '@/components/Home.vue'
import Blogs from '@/statics/blogs'

plus the array in thw main.js.

const routes= [
      {path: '/', name: 'first',component: pagina},
      ...blogRoutes
]

(what is blogRoutes? well te one for the pages and articles)

const blogRoutes = Object.keys(Blogs).map(section => {
    const children = Blogs[section].map(child => ({
      path: child.id,
      name: child.id,
      component: () => import(`./markdowns/${section}/${child.id}.md`)
    }))
    return {
      path: `/${section}`,
      name: section,
      component: () => import('./components/bak.vue'),
      children
    }
  })



and its the part I modyfied the less.

the readme just inform over the deply commands with nmp.

about the config.
we export modules that we downloaded.....(?)
anyway we use the vue-loader for the vue and the
use of markdown-loader for the md files. (interprets)


module.exports = {
  chainWebpack(config){
    config.module.rule('md')
      .test(/\.md/)
      .use('vue-loader')
      .loader('vue-loader')
      .end()
      .use('vue-markdown-loader')
      .loader('vue-markdown-loader/lib/markdown-compiler')
      .options({
        raw: true
      })
  }
}
