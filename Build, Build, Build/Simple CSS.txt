some CSS always usefull.

in our case for the biggest wrapper we got to:

  margin: 0 auto;

 0 px top bottom while left right is auto.

does font-weight even work?

font-weight:900;

doesnt font-size fo everything?

   font-size:75px;

text-align:center;
font-family:fantasy;
font-style:italic;

maybe having it as h1 tag doent allow too much experimintation

html tags or specific should be used before using pixel movements

sometimes they forget the px in css classes, 

even if its a list the space between them has to be set by you 
in margin/padding and stuff

if you want to select a class within a class just remember to use the dot.

    .cd-slider-nav .nav-link:focus {
        background-color: #1a2d4b;
    }
