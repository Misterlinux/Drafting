  <!DOCTYPE html>

and about the meta data or just add the class text-uppercase to the tag.to put in the head tag.

    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">

then if you have to load the css external files you can.

    <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/bootstrap.min.css"> 
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:300,400">  
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/hero-slider-style.css">  

ok so a bit of order:

<html>

<head>
  <title>

  </title>
</head>

<!-- here goes the meta/link stuff -->

</html>






if you want to select a class within a class just remember to use the dot.

    .cd-slider-nav .nav-link:focus {
        background-color: #1a2d4b;
    }


-if you have to just assign classes use Div TAG
<!-- this is a comment, text not code -->









the class text-uppercase used in the tag modify.

this is just a way to change the dimenzions directly on the tag
<div class="lefto">
  <img src="https://meme.xyz/uploads/posts/t/l-31270-undercover-cop-at-a-festival-starter-pack.jpg" 
  alt="IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE" width="240" height="200" border="3" /></a>
</div>

kinda a list with a principal text element.

  <dl>
    <dt>Coffee</dt>
    <dd>- black hot drink</dd>
    <dd>- black hot drink</dd>
    <dt>Milk</dt>
    <dd>- white cold drink</dd>
  </dl>  

or in other case table-dark

<table class="table">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">#</th>
      <th scope="col">First</th>
      <th scope="col">Last</th>
      <th scope="col">Handle</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">1</th>
      <td>Mark</td>
      <td>Otto</td>
      <td>@mdo</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">2</th>
      <td>Jacob</td>
      <td>Thornton</td>
      <td>@fat</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">3</th>
      <td>Larry</td>
      <td>the Bird</td>
      <td>@twitter</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

Here is my view and I hope it will be yours as well while being here in my own designed development path.
ok so, we can divide a text in columns.

  div {
    column-count: 3;
    column-rule-style: dotted;
    column-rule-color: lightblue;
    column-rule-width: 1px;
    column-width: 300px;
  }

we also get a -style proposition, complesitory. selector
and if you want to work them all togheter.

  div{
    column-rule: 1px solid lightblue;
  }

anyway if you want to have a title on the columns.

  h2 {
    column-span: all;
  }

and with width you get the space of the columns.
transition is like border a shorthand property.

we start with defining the html:

  <div class="box"></div>

and then the css.

  .box {
    width: 150px;
    height: 150px;
    background: red;
    margin-top: 20px;
    margin-left: auto;
    margin-right: auto;
    -webkit-transition: background-color 2s ease-out;
    -moz-transition: background-color 2s ease-out;
    -o-transition: background-color 2s ease-out;
    transition: background-color 2s ease-out;
  }

  .box:hover {
    background-color: green;
    cursor: pointer;
  }

ok so, we define the area and the transition works only if there is a :hover
and like always we set [target][time][way]
or we can use the:

  transition: all 0.5s ease;

to refer to all the values within.
you can also set different types of transition.

  transition: background 0.2s ease,
              padding 0.8s linear;

some propierties arent animatable.
anyway if you did that for hoven and not the pricipal you would have get a transition
on but not out (considering that hoven worked only when in)

in the past I used to work with:
  git clone https://github.com/<your_username_here>/exceptional-realty1
  cd exceptional-realt

cloning a github file and then entering it.
CSS cascading style sheests, a destop-down or a mobile-up.
so, about a media query is built.

  @media only screen and (max-width: 992px) {
     body {
       background-color: blue;3
     }
  }

not, only: media queries inehit the past properties so you need to chnge only the 
new ones.

<eta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
is something we can use in the metadata on the head of my html file.
setting the zoom as the same as the width of the page.

ok so, lets try the css selector.
  tag.class
it seems we can do this to select a class in a tag.

firstag secondtag.class
if we are going trought give the first and second with a space.

for multiple selectors just 
  first,second

anyway use * to select all.

  tag > * (everything on a plate)

  tag + tag (to select with tag anything close/ immedianly after a plate)

ok so, ternary operation to do the conditions faster.

  bento + .small, .small + pickle

in case you wish for 2 consecuent elements after bento.

anyway if you want to select the first tag INSIDE another tag (not sucessive like > (I guess))
____ > ____:first-child

_____ > _____, _____ to select a list of elements that are after the first.

.small:last-child

ok so, depending on which position are you inside a tag (unless you are the only one
in that case it is first-child, only-child, last-child)
anyway what we did up there is chosing all the .small elements that are inside another tag
AND are last (if its inside another and there is first then it doesnt count)
also remember the -small refers to the element itself not the container

and we can use numerical order with :nth-child(position)
and 0 doesnt count

and we have order even for the :last-child
in fact we can call:
  
  :nth-last-child(3)

with which we choose any element that is the 3 last (starting from the botton)
[this includes all sub tags]
so if we chose ____:nth-last-child(3)
we chose the 3 last between the same tags as ___
(so if the 2^ to last has others minis inside, those arent counted not like it was with 
the simpler :)

  ____:first-of-type

we select the first of a particular type.

bootstrap can defne colors by the class and we use the classes:
row and col- line-height: 1.5

ok so, if we are selecting specific elements, all the odd or even
  
  :nth-of-type(even)

this is for all the elements inside of it.

  :nth-of-type(2n+3)

ok so, this is for the same principle and we set up a rule and we set the +_ 
as a starting point to then add the _n (and you cant change the order of n and +)

html: structural information,
CSS hojas de estiloen cascada.

---------------------------------

NAVBAR, without using font awesome:


    <button class="navbar-toggler hidden-lg-up" type="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#tmNavbar">
        &#9776;
    </button>

and to see its function in the script

  $('#tmNavbar a').click(function(){
    $('#tmNavbar').collapse('hide');     
  });

while here some css:

.navbar-toggler {
  float: right;
  font-size: 1.75rem;
  padding: 1rem 1.5rem;
  background: rgba(255,255,255,0.7);
  border-radius: 0;
  position: absolute;
  right: 20px;
  top: 5px;
}

I guess to have it tapped

                <li class="selected">


ok so, to take screenshots just logo + 


.thin_border{
  border: 1px solid black;
}

<h1 class="Primo" style="margin-left: 200px"> Showdown teambuilding </h1>

styling directly.

<em> <strong> Scrafty </strong> </em>  kinda corsivo

to give a space between next to other text -> &nbsp 

(maybe in the text already)


anyway javascipt
  The <span id="nombre" onclick="Surprise();">
    worst
  </span> 
  member of the team 
  
calling the function on a specific event (onclick)

.muestra{
  white-space: pre;
  overflow: hidden;
  max-height: 100px;
}
on our first page we got text on a column of white with limited text and setted height


<ul class="list-group">
<li class="list-group-item active">

bootstrap list (-active to get the text in blue)

to get the text as you wrote it on the html -> white-space: pre;

changing set ID with a loop.

        var counter = 0;
        function count(){
          counter = counter +1;
          if (counter == 1){
            $("#posto").text(counter + " volta");           
          }
          else{
            $("#posto").text(counter + " volte");
          }
        }

The .off() method removes event handlers that were attached with .on(). 




    <nav class="navbar navbar-default">
