ok so, if you want a fast gradient for the images here it is.
from c40815 to 62040a with a 30/40 visibility+

ok so, lets try something new. desaturate > seppia 0.6
then we set the trasparency at 40% and lets see.

ok lets deposit some data for each new argument.


  <div class="col-md-6 argument">

  <router-link to="/microe">

    <div class="product-item-title d-flex ">
      <div class="bg-faded p-lg-2 ml-auto rounded">
        <div class="p-3 mr-2">
            <a href="#" class="underlined underlined--reverse">About the Design of things</a>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

    <img class="product-item-img mx-auto d-flex rounded img-fluid " src="../assets/microe3.jpg" alt="">

  </router-link>
    <div class="product-item-description d-flex ml-auto">
      <div class="bg-faded p-5 rounded">
        <div class="d-flex justify-content-between">
          <div class="">December | 2019</div>
          <div class=""> core </div>
        </div>
        <div class="h4"><em><b>Design</b></em></div>
        the world is based on mechanics and being able to developt them as 
        dynamics means having the world in a pocket. or at least being ablr to create them
        each any single part.

        <footer class="blockquote-footer text-right">about the core</footer>

      </div>
    </div>

  </div>

just a template.

      <del> deleted part </del> 
      and also the idea of 
      <u> having something underlined </u> 
      and also we can work with 
      <small> the smaller part </small>
      and what about the abreviation is
      <abbr title="smaller texto">like</abbr> 

ok so, if you wat a simple new element key in the json file just.

    "Secondo": [
        {
            "id": "suono",
            "date": "25 agosto, 2019",
            "title": "this is the second",
            "description": "it should be all ok."
        }
    ],
