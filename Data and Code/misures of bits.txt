I already knew that the level of research to say and express everything I have o say would be hue but
I never expected to have to re search for data after just after 17 words of my forst post, anyway it 
was referring to the measure of data strage and the number 5571.

anyway lets start with the bits and how we can work with those numbers.
units of measure....anyway we are talking about digital information.
ok so, BINary digit = Bit (I guess where the t come from tho, maybe they dont have anything in common)
anyway 1/0 on off of the electronic data/ NO, values.

8 bits = 1 byte . for a ASCHII / ASCII character. digit.
kKB kilobyte: It should be 1000... and its close, 1024.which is 2^10 
remember thet computers think in base 2, not base 10 like us.
(binary math vs decimal math)

1kb = 1024 bytes

anyway now we think on MB and GB.

1Mb = 1024 kb = 1024^2 bytes which are then 1024^Â£ bits.
1Gb = 1024 Mb.

anyway 1Tb is about a library and 1500 Cd.
ok so, what about the b and the B.
well if 3Mbps we are talking about 3 megabits for second 0.3 bytes
while the opposite would be 0.3 MBps (anyway mea is about 10^ 2 I gues)
ok so, mega is referred to 1 000 000.

ok so the difference between 3 Mbits and 3Mbytes is simple 8
which means that the first is just 0.375 Mbytes of the other (just ignore the mega)

1Mb is a book so.
