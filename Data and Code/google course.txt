### about the google course

piattaforma?? Is this just aws??
big data, amd ML, are the services oriented for thos?

GCP, esattamente come aws, same stuff, checking if I can actually use it
wow carbon neutral.. nice, 

ok lets gets some tips for the audio.

ctrl t for crop. 
light noise reduction, normalize the audio
I guess light the audio is something that can be done more times.
and compres, 
qualize, and normalize again.
impost limits about levels.

creating a 'favorite'

anwyay we cut a part of the mute audio to check the noise,
we selec all the audio and then we process it.

next we go to normalize and go to a -3 / 6 db.

compression is about the hights, nice, 
Single band compressor, 
we get the soglia -12 db and the moltiplicator to reduce the peaks by a factor.

we choose the parametric equalizer from filtro and EQ,
fra le opzioni vediamo ottimizzatore vocale.

dynamic processing can help in case of isolated peaks, 

le app creano dati da conservare/storage..

dati processati in informazioni.... dinamiche ML.

servers in regions > zones and with 100 miles between regions.
and can be done with the multi zone, 
Virtual private cloud...cioe le rete fra I server.  cioe VPC.

and also this is fragmented in regional subnets.. for each 
ok so the vpc net is made of subnets that can communicate with each other.
but its isolated so with different vpc even same-regions subnets are
isolated.

singolo indirizzo ip in cui montare risorse tra vari componenti in differenti
regioni/indirizzi.

Cloud load balancing. and they adapt themselves with different load / traffic.

it offers also a cache , content delivery network.... so about data that
the user request and then gets using a faster note.

ok so, with the term resourse we talk about the virtual machine/ data that
we are using trought this service, all of them /each,
associated to a project.....and then in folder...
project can be de-centralized, different accounts . and billing
are calculated there.
located trought ID, user named, or gcp number of series.

folders cant contain other folders and projects, 
to help the level tree of different teams / organize.

organization nodo, to grant policy to some users, or to create project(use, costs)for such users.
policy to folders, projects or from the node, 
cascading, an upper level retains its policy, 

it can be granted to a G account / group, and you can check what someone does with 
setting the roles, (which define what it can do), 
we get to a primitive level, which include predefinite roles such as

check bills, read only, editor and owner who can add or remuve utents
or project. (normally more thn 1)

from primitive to predefine.
about what resourses exactly it uses, 

we can customize it even more with custom, not in folders but in 
projects, etc.
we cam create roles, 

next to see N. 4.

console web, interfaccia interattiva, operazionion amministrative.
centralized, about resorces and services, controll over.
and the resources git, 

and also google cloud SDK, piu complesso e specific, 

RESTful about json data between user and system, API, 

google delivers, libraries for coders, meanwhie the client librar are community based.
cloude shell is a terminal which allow us access with a terminal to
our resources and any code.

and freedom in editing.
