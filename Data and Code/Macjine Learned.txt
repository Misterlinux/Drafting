Recursion, solving problems function calls as subroutine, reducing problems 
to subproblems, base and set of rules.

Flow of Release/Update, Developers and operators, use of automatic tools, Devops.

Machine learning =/= Deep Learning, simulate neural network by ALgorithms(Nivelli di unata no allineata).
Scalability, quantity and type of data used.

Each level different by Abstraction to -> Extract,Characterize and Transform.

Competition between 2 neural networks with GAN(Generative Advanced Network)
0 sum game on 20k's of captcha syntentized and translated.

DLD (Digital Logic Dence) , the Logical circuit, in which swichs carry logical
operation (AND /OR /NOT /NOR /NAND), organized into logic gates to controll the flow of the circuit.
flow of Binary information, as physical quantit (voltage) then processed.
Anyway also Logical operation with logical inputs, for a singular output.

Machine learning expertise -> mathematical-computatinal methods.
result = performance, we can Ispezionare/not ispezionare.
both data but, one named data(etiquete)/other not (semi).
Rinforzo = reconpenses and penalties on learning.
