Version control strategy and tooling 
Is it industry standard? Git, TFS, SVN or Mercurial? If you’ve heard of it, it should be okay.
Is there CI/CD tooling and environments in place?
Deployments should be as automated as possible. It’ll make your life so much easier.
How often are deployments?
What frameworks/languages will I be working in?
What tooling do you use? Which IDE?
Visual Studio, Rider or IntelliJ are some good options.
What kind of projects will I be working on?
What kinds of technologies will the company be looking to use next? Also, what kind of horizon are these changes at?
How far off are they from becoming day-to-day in use at the company?
