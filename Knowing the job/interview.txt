ok so, time for some toast.
Fibonacci frequence.
ok so, the idea is simple, starting from the pairing 0,1
all numbers in this sequence will be the sum of thei previous numbers.

function something(n){
	if (n===2){
		return 1;
		//this cover the first element (the 1, we will do the same for the 2)
	}
	else if(n===1){
		return 0;
		//this for the first very number 0.
	}
	else{
		return something(n -1) + something(n -2);
	}
}

for writing out your own testing you can try with.
anyway memoize present for the precompiled first elements of an array.

function something(n, memoize = {1:0, 2:1}){
	if (n in memoize){
		return memoize[n];
	}
}
we get the first 2 elements resolved for the first interaction of the code.

ok so, the exercise of a matrix in which the 0 and 1 
the idea is to visualize the entire matrix as a graph.
and then use algorithms graph traversal. 
the idea is to iterate trought close cross squares
and get the lenght of the river.

ok so, if sendingemails try to put your phone number on it
to more contactivity.

responding warm regards / best regartry to thank for the time, etc and try to
set up why you prefer this job, check interviewers and the company.
or even the CEO or CTO, or about ex employeers.
in interview speak less, and no mid-sounds.
check their dressCode in their gallery.

Put on you deciion to be what you planning.
dont talk trash of past jobs talk about challenges or better chances.

On what you built and problems solved, the created app, 
talk about solutions not complainings, ask if you didnt understand something
at the test,
