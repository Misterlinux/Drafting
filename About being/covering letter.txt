Hi Alice,

I'm Bob, a web developer currently available for full-time employment.

According to your company website, you're currently hiring web developers. Based on the information outlined there, I believe I would make a good addition to your team.

You might notice that I don't have any commercial experience, so I would be applying to this role as a junior developer. While I've never worked as a full-time web developer before, I'm proficient with many of the technologies listed in your requirements, have deployed working software and believe I would contribute value to your development team from day one.

Please find attached my CV with links to code samples and projects that demonstrate my abilities. Additionally, you can see my profile on github here: http://github.com/example-example-example

It would be great to meet for a chat at some point if you have any interest in taking this further.

Kind Regards,

-Bob, http://bobthewebdeveloper.example.com/
