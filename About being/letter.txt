This letter is to express my enthusiasm in the project proposed by the cs in hun.
given my activity on local volunteer in and out of school institutions
I was looking for the opportunity to try out my set of skill out of my 
area of confort and the possibility offered by your organitation to
work in such and envirodment as the one that this NGO
would be un-valiable.

During my training, being it formal or informal, I learned the importance of 
management of time and resources with in mind the goal to reach elasticity and versatility
that would allow me to fit and be an assest on any team or to 
produce on my own, 

my goal is to reach that trough the interaction of vulnerable groups with 
all the challenges that it involves / are implied
and where in shorts matter the most (does it matter)

I look forward to discussing my capabilities in more detail 
and am available for a personal interview at your convenience at the adresses on the
here presents.

best regards

AZ.

It was with much interest that I learned that STPLN offers the opportunity to
experience their unique and challengin envirodment to work in.
Given my experience with formal and informal education I was searching for the opportunity
to partecipate in an envirodment ____ to reach to understand interdisciplinary storytelling.
and the space and possibilities offered by STPNL would be un-valiable.

During my years of training I understood from the ver beginning how in the current time
with the quantity of possibilities, data and information tools avaiable
being self driven and being able to organise one own path ndependetly
would be un-valiable, searching for chalenging one owns skill is the 
natural path after learning it and to reach a grade of completition

experience, these are the reason In my case I decided to arcive this with code

I am excited to learn about the opportunity offered by Open Cultural Center.
Being able to employ my strong commitment in code where it matterers
would be unvaliable experience.

One of the advantages of my informal training was the possibility
to be at both ends of the learning process.
Programming is about problems, preferiably about resolving them, and how a list of commands
or syntax rules wont always cut it.
Code can be conveyed to everyone and can fit to anyone's goals.
Code is a language and a tool, being able to work togheter
with the ones that need it the most is my commitment. 

I would welcome the opportunity to meet with you to discuss my qualifications 
for this position in more detail. Thank you for your time and consideration.

I found the actions proposed by the country I live in ,during and after the migrant crysis, blameful.
But I prefer action, not plain and uneffective indignation, 
and I intend to act for others to define my own potential, and theirs.


I plan to mix my formal education on code with informal activity.
to developt a better management skills I started doing volontary activity 
while for the more tecnical knoledge while studyng programming at university Spienza of Rome.
