operating systems like OS gives us a graphical interface to
do, but a sympler way is the command line/ prompt / CLI.
to open terminal:

	crtl+alt+t
 
Most of this is for linux systems:

	$ echo "Hello World"
	Hello World
	$

to print out some values, explain what you learned

whats an interface: system used to operate a computer.
hwo the information is showen, and how to work.
about the disply of what is shown and commands for.

Starting with CLI display: to open terminal Ctrl+Alt+T
	ubuntu@chopin:~$
	[user]@[hostname]:[current_directory]$

here we have an example, we get the user and the computer name.
the : is just for separation and we get in which directory we are or just a ~
for the home directory:

	to check list elements inside the folder ls/

the elements that happear are 
-prompt: which would be the folder you hare in.
-the cursor, which would be the intermitted space in which you can put text
-the input: what you type
-output of your commands and programs: the response by the pc.

	ctrl+à is for the ""

we type echo "___" to rappresent some text in the terminal.
it sends some text to the CLI output.

	pwd to check out where you are.

commands in [command] [arguments...] form, and can act on a file or
be pre-build (like echo) the arguments in this case are Strings passed to the programs, information
provided to it.

	crtl+ò for the :

archive, compress, and extract files with tar (granted you give it the info)
with also some ending position, 

	ctrl+3 is for the #
