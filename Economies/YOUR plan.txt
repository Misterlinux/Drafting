-Mint for management with bills and stuff or some tps on investement

-Etoro: 2.5/5 trustpilot, 20$ min, 62% loss dollars paypall also but 3-5 days
25$ fix on prelievi, spreads on:
Azioni	0 commissioni ? CFD  0,09% + overnight (6,4% long, 2,9% short) ? ETF 0,09% senza leva / come i CFD altrimenti
-(Ogni trader dovrà autonomamente dichiarare al fisco il suo conto di trading (trattasi di un conto estero) e nel caso saldare le imposte compilando il modello F24.)
and dividens are deposited, 

plus 500 CFD, 100$ minimun, you could get 5$ mouth if less 3 trades?dichiarazione redditi
min 95$ for retire, 

ok so, lets try the VTI on both:
in plus we cant take little pieces and have only 1, $ ‪143,22‬ = € ‪131,95‬ / margine? $ ‪28,64‬ = € ‪26,39‬
‎0,51%‎ dal tasso corrente

ok so, etf tend to have spread (on cents or variables) or overnight (% of what bought)
and the ones with no overnight has scadenza.
