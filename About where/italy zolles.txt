something about some zones of italy.

cunicoli di claudio and nerone in the Avezzano mines to 
give them air, Alessando torlonia.
1862, 

ok so, Rome, wasnt carring, more like a weight, even if its the capital
stagnat for 20 years, de responsability of abitants on economic and socials
roma during the past secolo, on minor manifator alimented by statal industries also, culture and 
public sector, and edilizia expansion and work.
rome is slowering and decreasing faster than the national average, also surroundings.
dinamismo economicoper nclusione sociale, piccole aziende sottocapitalizzate 
and the small borges incapable of carrying the lower startes.
dare certezze al settore privao, needing market to check efficency of
public services? but controllo propetario del publico per sussidi
piani pluriannuali per impiego, come a milano con modello, and less concentrated turism

but what about milano, with less money and opportunities which kinda of major
with the investments and the quartieri and ferrovie, maybe like londra that 
requieres too high salaries, also the taxes to build are low but the rent is rising
(oneri di urbanizzazione)
