ok so, about the new members:

the Consiglio dellâ€™Unione Europea, which rapresentatnts of the 27 goverments
of the eu, found an accord/deal for the macedonia/albania to enter, this will be passed
to the Consiglio europeo , in videoconferenza, by the heads of state or goverment
of countries, so , it was 6 years ago that the negotiation to let
the 2 enter were stopped.
anyway the last war in the balcans was in the first half '90
anyway the change of the name by macedony to avoid having veto fron greace

after the first dpubts by france it seems there were a middle point, still not know
anyway knot means to act on states that are already in.
official candidates still get some founds like 6 Mil from 2014
with turkey still receiving most of it even if its deal was stopped years ago.
