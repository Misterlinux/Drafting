MatLab.

some tips.
ok so, matlab works with command lines after the >>
case sensitives, variables can only contain letters or _
to save workplace as a file just save _____.mat (I guess its like hitfilm)

pi is P-greek and even if shown 4 decimal is used much presisely.
3.1416, 
code can be organized in scripts. divided in sections.
as a mat file or static pdf.
and creating variales you can, l = 3 and l = r

and order is important when setting variables.
you can add new Breacks and choose when to add
Text and Code.

all variables are arrays, from singular cell = scalar
matrix, vector (column + row)

like x = 2 / x = [2 9] (spaces or commas) / while x = [2;9]
ok so, the variable content you put as code will be shown graphically
how to matrix (lika all of things starting in X)
so x = [1 2 3; 4 5 6]   1 2 3
                        4 5 6 

values that need to be processes can still be put in an array x = [sqrt(10) abs(-4)]

MATrix LABoratory, if numeric vectors and linear you can:
x = 2:5 (with both included)

standard spacing is 1 but you can set it x = 1: 0.5: 5
(ok so we get the spacing in the middle and the last number at the end)

now you can set the numbers of elements in the array between:
x = linspace(1, 12, 3) (a total of 2 elemenst with 1,6, 12 it includes both starts)

and the past operation created row arrays/vectors
if changing x = x' from a row to a vector

some pre-built matrixes like random numbers 
-x = rand(2) 
here for how many for side; and if you wana controll that use 
x = rand (X, Y)
or
x = zeros(X, Y)
ok so, if you wanna check a matrix dimensions
size(x) 
and you can use it as meter to create new matrixes
rand(size(x))

so having a pre-existing matrix you can index out a value with
x = ____(x,y)
and if you search the last element in a X, Y
x = _____(end,Y) in this case searching the last of a colum

and in case of second to last end-1
x = ____(end-1, Y)

: colon operator

ok so, if you need to cut a particular part.
x = _____(:, Y) in this case taking the whole Y column

ok so, now imagine having to create an array from pre-existing
x = ____(:, 3,4) ok so we get the last columns the 3 and 4, (included all the x in :)

ok so, and if you have 1 dimension matrix use:
x = ____(4)
and if a range of:
x = ____(4:8) from the 4th to the 8th

ok so, if you need to change a value:
___(2) = 0.5 target the value and change it
you can do this even for 2 coordinates

ok so, array can have added values simply, creating new matrix
x = ___ +1

statistical operation like checking the Max value on an array
x = max(____)
and operations can be performed in all.
x = round(___)

ok so multiplication =/= matrix multiplication
so to multiply the values INSIDE the matric use:
final = first .* secon (both being matrixes)
anwyay there can be more selective operations

x = [1 2; 3 4; 5 6] .* [2; 3 ; 4]
here any element of the different row is multiplied by a different value

ok so, the results of the size(x) function can be declared in numbers and variablees.
-[onevar, sec_var] = size(_____)

ok so, having a vector and trying to get 2 values
[firsto, secondo] = max(_____)
you get as first MAX while the second POSITION

in case you wanted to concentrate on 1 variable 
-[~,ivMax] = max(v2)

ok so, random numbers in a matrix use method:
- x = randi([range start, range end], [number of rows, colums])

- doc randi 
if for a direct command

ok so, what would happen if we took 2 vector same lenght
would we get a matrix? or a kind of L
well no, you get a grafic.

plot(x_vector, y_vector)

and the line used to connect the dots, 

plot(x_vector, y_vector, "simbols for the line OR dots")

like "; , --, -, -."
ok so, if you want to add more vectors to an already existing matrix or grapgh

hold on <- command
plot(x_vectors, y_vectors, "ks") 

to commands to methods just break the line.

hold off

if you plot one vector you will just get the function/plot
with another vector n+1 style

ok so, you can customize the line with ""

plot(vector, "LineWidth", 3) 

here for example we get the property to set the linewidth.

the plot( ) creates lines and with properties
while histogram has Y bars.

title("you can put a label title on it")

and in case you wanted to add the 

ylabel("Y axis text")

ok so, having 2 different type of dots you can set a legend to differentiate it

legend("first type of dots", "the second")

anyway if you want to add more element in the title and also adding vector elements

title("welcome " + "to the " + "sample(3)") for example

ok so imagine havig a matrix and wanting to load it.
and then to use it.

load electricity
usage

Nan (Not a number)
ok so, If I want to use the matrix in it

usage(2,3) = 2.74

ok so, imagine having a matrix with 2 vectors and havng to add comparatives

plot(x,y, "r--")
hold on
plot(x,y, "k-.")
plot(x,y, "y.")
hold off

ok so, we use the first hold on to keep us in the matrix then we add the others
to then hold off(?) which is not necessary but still.

ok so, having to count the numbers of element in a vector

numel(y)

ok so, you can divide, then set new variables to plot with

ok so fourier, information about the frequency, 
they tend to be complex numbers so use abs after the fft

abs(fft(Y))

ok so x limits....

xlim ([0 1000])

ok so, in case you want to extract a variale with data (or a column, I will see)
_____._____  (first as matrix while the second as variable)

if pre-existent metrix gets operations on that include the other variables a new
variable will be created in te matrix

ok so, you can interact with variables values using the frop down near them
and you will get a update button option.

but you can do that 1 colon at the time, 
ok so I was right, to get rows its different

_____(1, :) at the first yiu can use 1:_ to get more, it will be a table.

true false as 1/0
going for a simple relationa operation will give the result

pi < 4 
1

ok so you can compare values to vectors and matrix
giving a string of results comparing every element

v1 < 4 
[will result in 0 1 1 0 0 0 1]

ok so, if you wanna go beyond and actually create an array with the values
on a variable stored

v = v1(v1 < 4) you need to repeat to get the values and not just the true/false report

ok so logical indexing on different vectors
elements in sample corresponding to where v1 is less than 4 (??)

V = sample( v4 < 4)

ok so, modyfing values which have qualities

v1(v1 < 4) = 0
SETTING values in v1 that are less that 4 as 0, and ending v1

and & / or |
you can set conditions

v1(v1 < 4 & v1 > 8) ok so, all elements as a vector less than 4 more than 6
v1(v1 < 10 | v1 > 3) more that 3 OR less than 10

ok so, conditionals and loops
maybe ... are used when breaking the line

elseif
used here

ok so:

for idx = 1:7

end

ok so, set a counter start finish and : as intermex as before
ok so, in case you wanna repeat the loop for as long the vector is

for 1:lenght(density) function, linked to the metrix vector

red if moving away while blue if closer, thats color influence on star movement

ok so Remember, column vector and steps (start: step: end)
and in case you do that and you wanted a column just at the end '

take the column 
spectra(:,6)

loglog(__,__," ") (as the plot function)

ok so, imagine having to set a variable with multiple properties

[first, second] = min(s)
here for example we get the min value AND its index (2 outputs)

the second is the index, and check the value corresponding to the index
in another matrix

lambda (idx)

ok so, you can modify the index used more easily
controls -> numeric slide -> right click -> configure on steps and stuff

a semi colon can hide the results of the imput

you can use the up arrow to chage previous results

clc to clean all the previous
